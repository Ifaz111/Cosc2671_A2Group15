between it happening in the 60s with technology that had less input power than a calculator, humans never going back despite every other piece of technology advancing throughout these last 60 years, the van allen belt, fuel capacity, suspicious photography, nasa being led by a nazi at the time, awkward astronauts at the press conference looking like they just got away with a crime...all back in the 60s before dvds and the internet was even invented, i can see why some question it.

i think it's an american pride thing. the propaganda was at an extreme level when it happened in the 60s and some don't have it in them to think that maybe it could have been fake. especially on a site like reddit where space exploration is pushed hard. so i'd like to ask, on an emotional level, would the lunar landing being fake deeply upset some of you?

conspiracy,the moon landing... why you are right.,"did neil armstrong and buzz aldrin land on the moon?

was it faked to make it look like they did?

yes.

simple answer that i hope will bring an end to some of the wilder nonsense that comes up here...

it was a ""space *race*"" between the usa and the ussr, both spending millions to be the first.  

sputnik and yuri gargarin meant the soviets had won ""round 1"".

america had to win the race to get a man on the moon. not close, not nearly. it had to happen, one way or another.

so they made sure. they rigged the game just in case.

pre filming the whole thing ( complete with iffy flag and ""rock number 7"") they had a back up in case anything went wrong. then went ahead with the real mission. that's why there appear to be 2 models of lunar module, 2 different moon buggies arguments about the flag photos etc.

rehearsed lines, gaps in communications so at any time during the mission, they could ""splice in"" the pre recorded footage and still get the win.

but it went right, and america got its victory, nearly bankrupting the soviet space programme in the process.

but they failed to destroy the back up footage and photos, and they got mixed in when the hype was huge, any photo, any clip to keep the masses on the high of victory.

i mean, i still have back up versions of windows xp on cd for fucks sake, in case the ""original"" screwed up. lol.

but it never did. and neither did the landing.

but it could have ended in a fireball 46 minutes in, and we would *never* have known.

they could have faked a failed re entry *after* the ""successful"" mission to plant the flag. or a drowning in the ocean, or a hundred versions.

after the mission was deemed a ""success"".

conspiracy,why i believe the moon landing was faked,"ok chatgpt i locked me out cuz i kept adding other trends. but simply in life new technology achievements explode in growth.. often exponentially.. it's the case since we discovered how to use fire.. as people figure things out and simply get better at them. 

except for the moon landings.. only the apollo trips then poof, we're back to being cave men who can't figure this out. i used to joke with friends that my belief in the moon landing drops an additional %1 each year without another moon landing.. so by now i feel it's more likely that we didn't pull it off.. my phone is more powerful than nasa and russia combined back then.. i just can't fathom not having thousands of moon landings by all nations by now.. just like how we spammed sending satellites once we pulled it off. 

the footages looks really weird.. but it's not personally my strongest driver.. can't tell for certain 

i don't have strong explanations of the counter arguments, but here are my best attempts:

how they kept the secret? something like fly me to the moon, except they didn't land.. they aired the tapes. only astronauts and very limited people knew.. probably very strong incentives/threats were involved to hush this limited group

what about the equipment they left there? not sure if that's true.. can't verify.. but even if they are there.. these are not humans.. equipment could've been left in some of the unmanned trips.

why didn't other countries point it out? not sure if they didn't. can't verify. if so, maybe they didn't have evidence to point it out.. cuz i don't have anything strong besides breaking the tech adoption trend.. which took decades to be very visible.

conspiracy,the 1969 usa moon landings were almost certainly faked,"enough of this covid shit, lets introduce some of our new members to a classic conspiracy: the greatest lie ever told… the moon landings.

i’ll edit this as we go, but to start i’ll lay out the premise in the best way i’ve found. i often talk to people about this and 95% of people won’t even consider the possibility that the moon landings were faked. the most concise teaser question i have come up with is this:

> in a hotly contested space race with russia, in the cold war era, jfk announces that the united states will “land a man on the moon and return him safely to earth before the end of the decade” (before 1970). this is his promise, and failure was not an option. can you imagine that there was at least a *potential* backup plan to fake it, if we couldn’t do it for real? and if there was such a plan, how would you know which happened?


## “why would russia go along with it if it was faked?”

answer: they didn’t! [even today only 31% of russians think the us moon landings were real!](https://www.newsweek.com/moon-landing-hoax-russia-poll-1521595)


## “you can tell they landed on the moon because they left retro reflectors that you can bounce a laser off of!” 
(some even cite [this mythbusters clip](https://youtu.be/vmvxsfnjyca))

answer: disregarding the spread of a laser over that distance… and the way it would reflect back to a point kilometers away from the source due to the earths rotation during the round trip… [mit conducted the first successful lunar laser range finding experiments in 1962 (pdf warning)](https://www.nature.com/articles/1941267a0.pdf), over 7 years before the supposed moon landings - no retroreflector required.


## “why would the us fake it?”

answer: this is an easy one! [wagging the moon doggie](https://centerforaninformedamerica.com/moondoggie-1/) has a very interesting (and long) history of the geopolitical happenings of the time and why faking it would have been in the us’ interest, which i summarize as:
* to “win” the space race
* to stoke patriotism
* to distract from the vietnam war (which was very unpopular at the time)
* and to hide funding for missile research
among other things… definitely recommend wagging the moon doggie as further reading on the topic!


##“it would have been harder/impossible to fake than it would be to do it for real!” or “they didn’t have the technology to fake it!” 
(some cite [this adam ruins everything video](https://youtu.be/dwbyaxhh3u4) as proof, which essentially says they would have needed a million lasers to fake the lighting)

answer: saying it would be “impossible” to fake is almost as ludicrous as saying it would have been impossible to do for real. if we had the tech to go to the moon, surely faking it would have also been possible. movies made in the same timeframe (2001: a space odyssey and capricorn one) both contain convincing moon scenes… if you haven’t seen capricorn one, it’s a pretty underrated movie that gives a very compelling explanation of how and why it could have been faked. recommended watch.


## “you really think thousands of people involved in the apollo mission could have kept it a secret all this time?”

answer: of course “everyone” at nasa wouldn’t have needed to know it was fake! if you consider the premise that the goal was to do it for real (and fake it if they couldn’t), only a very small number of people would need to be “in the know”. the people who wrote the software and designed the space toilets clearly wouldn’t have to know it was fake!

## “you can see apollo remnants on the moon with a powerful enough telescope”

answer: no, you literally just cannot. i’ve had people claim that they’ve see it with a telescope and their own eyes - there is no telescope on earth powerful enough to see any apollo mission remnants on the moon. [it’s a physical impossibility.](https://www.scienceabc.com/eyeopeners/can-we-use-telescopes-to-see-if-the-moon-landings-were-real.html)
the only images of remnants come curtesy of guess who - nasa, via the lunar reconnaissance orbiter (lro). but why would nasa lie? /s",oxfouzer,68,2022-01-11 14:59:20,s13ln5,185,"the 1969 usa moon landings were almost certainly faked enough of this covid shit, lets introduce some of our new members to a classic conspiracy: the greatest lie ever told… the moon landings.

i’ll edit this as we go, but to start i’ll lay out the premise in the best way i’ve found. i often talk to people about this and 95% of people won’t even consider the possibility that the moon landings were faked. the most concise teaser question i have come up with is this:

> in a hotly contested space race with russia, in the cold war era, jfk announces that the united states will “land a man on the moon and return him safely to earth before the end of the decade” (before 1970). this is his promise, and failure was not an option. can you imagine that there was at least a *potential* backup plan to fake it, if we couldn’t do it for real? and if there was such a plan, how would you know which happened?


## “why would russia go along with it if it was faked?”

answer: they didn’t! [even today only 31% of russians think the us moon landings were real!](https://www.newsweek.com/moon-landing-hoax-russia-poll-1521595)


## “you can tell they landed on the moon because they left retro reflectors that you can bounce a laser off of!” 
(some even cite [this mythbusters clip](https://youtu.be/vmvxsfnjyca))

answer: disregarding the spread of a laser over that distance… and the way it would reflect back to a point kilometers away from the source due to the earths rotation during the round trip… [mit conducted the first successful lunar laser range finding experiments in 1962 (pdf warning)](https://www.nature.com/articles/1941267a0.pdf), over 7 years before the supposed moon landings - no retroreflector required.


## “why would the us fake it?”

answer: this is an easy one! [wagging the moon doggie](https://centerforaninformedamerica.com/moondoggie-1/) has a very interesting (and long) history of the geopolitical happenings of the time and why faking it would have been in the us’ interest, which i summarize as:
* to “win” the space race
* to stoke patriotism
* to distract from the vietnam war (which was very unpopular at the time)
* and to hide funding for missile research
among other things… definitely recommend wagging the moon doggie as further reading on the topic!

conspiracy,do you think the moon landing was all a hoax? discuss.,"1.	the flag waving in the wind:
	•	conspiracy theorists often point to footage of the american flag appearing to wave as evidence that the moon landing was staged in a studio. since there is no atmosphere on the moon, they argue, the flag shouldn’t move. nasa explains that the flag moved due to the astronauts twisting the flagpole into the lunar soil, causing ripples that made it appear as though it was waving.
	2.	the shadows and lighting anomalies:
	•	skeptics claim that shadows in the moon landing photos are inconsistent, suggesting the use of multiple light sources, like those in a studio setting. however, experts explain that the uneven terrain on the moon and the sun as the single light source can create strange shadow angles. additionally, light reflecting off the lunar surface can cause such anomalies.
	3.	no stars in the photos:
	•	one of the most frequently cited pieces of “evidence” is the absence of stars in the photos taken on the moon. conspiracy theorists argue that this is because the landings were filmed on earth, and including stars would have made it difficult to fake the sky accurately. in reality, the cameras used by the astronauts were set with fast exposure times to capture the brightly lit lunar surface, which washed out the faint light from distant stars.
	4.	the van allen radiation belts:
	•	a significant argument is that the astronauts could not have survived the radiation in the van allen belts that surround the earth. skeptics argue that passing through these belts would have been lethal. however, scientists have pointed out that the apollo spacecraft were designed with sufficient shielding, and the astronauts passed through the belts relatively quickly, minimizing their exposure.
	5.	the lack of recent moon landings:
	•	some conspiracy theorists argue that the lack of recent manned missions to the moon is evidence that the original landings were faked, as nasa could not replicate the “hoax.” however, the real reason is more mundane: after the initial landings, public interest and government funding for moon missions waned, leading to the focus shifting to other space exploration projects.
	6.	the stanley kubrick connection:
	•	one of the more elaborate versions of the moon landing hoax theory claims that renowned filmmaker stanley kubrick was hired by nasa to direct the staged moon landings, using the techniques he perfected in his film 2001: a space odyssey. this theory suggests that kubrick’s detailed sets and groundbreaking special effects were used to convince the world that the u.s. had won the space race. there is no credible evidence to support this claim, and it remains a piece of speculative fiction.",LexiSexie,0,2024-09-02 05:41:27,1f6n4wh,30,"do you think the moon landing was all a hoax? discuss. 1.	the flag waving in the wind:

conspiracy,my take on how they faked moon landings,"i want to start this post by saying that i do not necessarily believe the moon landing was faked, but that if it were, then these are things i believe went down to make it happen. i wont discuss photos or videos or science, but more so l'm going to discuss human nature. and why we would have done what we did, and consequently, why others would have done what they did
i'll start by saying that i think too many people focus on the photos and pictures. let’s focus on other things.

like why would we do this in the first place and how would we technically do it. i am not the best writer and my thoughts can scatter while writing so please excuse any grammar errors. but this is a post of how i would do it if i were one of the original men in the room to plan this thing out.

first thing id like to point out that is a major plot point for the believers, is that if the moon landing was a hoax, than thousands or hundreds of thousands of people would have to be in on it. this is false in my mind.

imagine this...
a few men are in a room to have an important discussion, that discussion has to do with the race to the moon with the soviets. but it’s about more than that. merica!! lol these men truly believe in their hearts that getting to the moon is a must happen end game, one way or another. they have realized it is just not possible. they decide to fake the whole thing from the ground up, but here's the thing, they will not only be lying to the general public, they will be lying to there own family, friends, and co-workers. they will be lying to millions of people, with only as few people knowing the truth as possible. there will be scenarios in the future of this event where they literally waste peoples time and money in believing something is real when its not. but in some sort of patriotic love for the country, they believe this must happen. a plan is set in motion. with the approval of at least 1 extremely higher up individual. possibly the then current president and no other president since then knows the truth possibly.
*enter plausible deniability. lol

these few men are tasked with the above mention of fooling everyone. not everyone knows it is a lie. just them. there are training facilities built to train astronauts on future missions. these training facilities are where everything is filmed that we end up seeing. to the people working on the facilities in and around, they are all led to believe this is for training. no one knows this is actually to look like very precise training facility to simulate every aspect of what they expect to exhibit on the moon, but actually its for recording the missions that will later be released. the only people that know the truth are the original men and the astronauts. i do believe that every astronaut was given a ""offer they couldn't refuse"". this could be they were given money for life for them and there future family even with extreme consequences if they tell the truth. never paying taxes on anything(thanks armageddon for that plot idea). there was also the fact i believe they sorta brainwashed them into believing it was the right thing to do for the country and a very patriotic thing to do. every patriotic  american during this time period was definitely all for doing whatever needed to be done to make america first in everything, so the brainwashing probably wasn't that hard if they found the right people for the set up. 
when they would have future missions i believe it was all a show for everyone. everyone at ground control was being fed a show. think of the movie truman show. kinda like that but probably a bad example because i realize truman was 1 person being fooled by many. this is the opposite, many being fooled by a few.
the men along with the astronauts were somewhere watching flight control. and following them along the path of each mission and playing along. feeding them information to there instruments and monitors and voicing what needed to be said. some people will say this part in particular is just crazy, but i say to that that this way of doing it would be much easier in fact than convincing thousands of people to lie and hope no one tells the truth. you want to keep the people in the know to as little a number as possible. another thing would be that the usa was very aware that russian spies were in fact embedded within our space program. so, this would be a number one priority, to convince everyone in those rooms that the mission was real.
i want to remind you here that im not a firm believer of the missions being fake, i'm just saying if they were, then this is how i would have done it, which i think is plausible

so back to it. we must convince everyone in mission control including russian spies, there is no question that this is real. the making up of scenarios where there are dire situations just adds to the believability. having engineers running around doing mathematics and running through scenarios to get them back home. these people really are running around running the numbers and figuring this shit out, as they are very smart people.
the situation just isn't real. they are all basically in a mass simulation, with the wizard of oz behind the curtain. lol
they have to do this 5 more times for future missions as well. each time, they get better behind the scenes.
yes rockets really did go up in the air. the people just come back down right away and were picked up somewhere, or maybe they exit out the bottom of rocket into a tunnel before the launch happens. either way, i'm just saying yes the launches actually do happen. it’s a very strong visual to make the entire story believable.
people also point out that russia would have been the first to say we faked it if they thought so or had proof. i counter that by saying if i were over there and somehow did indeed find out that america was faking this whole thing, would i tell everyone? no. and here's why. i would have said to my fellow russians ""so the americans are faking all of this and we have proof?"" ""let them continue. they must be wasting mass recourses on this hoax, let them continue"" ""they will waste valuable time and money and we will move forward making mother russia great again"" lol
seriously though, if i knew my enemy was wasting valuable resources and time on this big of a hoax, i would hold that shit in my back pocket and let them continue to waste resources and time for as long as possible. i personally would not tell my enemy that i know the truth. i would hold onto that until i could use it as the ultimate blackmail. country vs country. they may wait until america is in a very vulnerable position and we are on the brink of civil war to release the information at a time to push us further into distrust of our government. but that would have to come at a very specific time of our downfall. again, just what i would do. haha
like i said im not necessarily a non believer that we went there, but i think its fun to imagine and if you really think about it, it would not be that hard to pull a veil over peoples eyes and put on a show. i mean i could be wrong, but hasn't this happened before, where everyone is so sure that something is a certain way, only to find out a long time later that it was in fact not what they thought all along. it's not out of the realm of possibilities.

ill end on this. if there was ever one thing that got me leaning towards thinking that maybe the moon landing was indeed faked, it wasn't any of the footage. it was the long post landing interview panel after the first mission.
something doesn't feel right. in the same way that when you watch police interrogation videos and they point out all the body language indicators of lying. it just felt off, and there were numerous moments where i was like ""something is weird with these guys""
that conference has always thrown me for a loop, weather they went or not. there’s this part where one of them points at a piece of paper and looks at the other indicating they should talk about whatever he’s pointing at, which happened to be about there feet as they walked through the moon dust. but the dudes body language and demeanor who’s pointing at the paper is the strangest thing i’ve ever seen. something out of a movie i swear.

ps - i use to believe that the moon landings were real, until i looked at the evidence.

+ all the accidents and mishaps occurred on the earth side.
never a single mishap on the moon side - because they were never there. 
simples.

+ have we been in low-earth orbit with astronauts?
 yes.

 have we landed on the moon many times with unmanned craft? 
yes. 

how do we know?
because there is independent corroboration of these things.

is the earth 🌎 a sphere?
yes.

- and not a single photo or video of the stars. they had plenty of time to make the video when they were allegedly flying to the moon. 
but not a single one.
any amateur astronomer could have used the position of the stars to determine exactly where the photo was taken from, and then the game would have been up, because they never left low-earth orbit.

- when the lem is allegedly taking off from the moon surface, the camera pans upwards and the  video is perfectly framed.
that's impossible.

  here they are trying to fake a video shot of being half way to the moon, when really they are in low-earth orbit. at about 34 minutes on the video. it was one of the tapes they forgot to delete or ""lose"". question - why try faking any videos if you really are travelling to the moon? they never left low-earth orbit. and that also is the limit of how far a person can travel into space today.

- bill kaysing was right all along.

- if they really had walked on the moon, then you can 100% bet that would be a bank holiday every year on that date. but there is no such bank holiday or day. says it all - 100% fake.

conspiracy,what if everything you were taught about space is a lie?,"for decades, we’ve been told that we live on a spinning ball, hurtling through space at 67,000 mph around the sun, inside a galaxy that itself is moving at 1.3 million mph. but here’s the thing—no one has actually proven this beyond carefully controlled government narratives, cgi images, and theoretical physics.

the average person has never seen earth from space. every image we are given is produced by nasa and its affiliates. every “scientific proof” is upheld by institutions tied to the same funding sources. and every time someone dares to question the official story, they are mocked, censored, or ridiculed instead of met with open discussion.

the nasa deception: $650 billion in taxpayer money, but no real photos?
since its founding in 1958, nasa has received over $650 billion in taxpayer money, yet:

🚀 they have never provided a single real-time, unedited video of earth rotating from space.
🚀 every so-called ‘photo’ of earth is either a composite or a cgi rendering.
🚀 they openly admit to manipulating images.

robert simmon, the nasa data visualizer responsible for the famous 2002 ""blue marble"" image, openly stated:

💬 “it is photoshopped, but it has to be.” – robert simmon, nasa

if they are truly taking real images, why do they need to photoshop anything at all?

even more suspicious—when you compare nasa’s images of earth over the years:

🔍 the continents change size.
🔍 the colors are inconsistent.
🔍 cloud patterns repeat—something that should be impossible.

ask yourself: if we are being shown real images of earth, why do they need to alter them?

why can’t we go back to the moon?
between 1969 and 1972, nasa allegedly sent men to the moon six times. yet in modern times, nasa has openly admitted that returning to the moon is a major challenge.

in 2015, nasa engineer kelly smith discussed the van allen radiation belts—a supposedly deadly region of space that astronauts must pass through to reach the moon. he stated:

💬 “we must solve these challenges before we send people through this region of space.” – kelly smith, nasa orion project

hold on. if we solved this challenge in 1969 with primitive computers and less computing power than a modern smartphone, why are we struggling decades later with vastly superior technology?

could it be that we never actually went in the first place?

furthermore:

🚀 nasa claims they ""lost"" the original moon landing telemetry data. how does that happen?
🚀 they claim they ""destroyed"" the technology to go to the moon and it’s too difficult to rebuild. does that sound like ""progress?""
🚀 the artemis program is delayed, over budget, and full of failures. if we went with 1960s tech, why is it so difficult now?

if you believe we landed on the moon, how do you reconcile these contradictions?

the problem with outer space: why can’t we feel the earth moving?
the heliocentric model tells us that earth is:

🌎 spinning at 1,000 mph
🌞 orbiting the sun at 67,000 mph
💫 moving with the galaxy at 1.3 million mph

yet:

📌 no one has ever felt this movement.
📌 no one has ever measured this movement directly.
📌 every experiment designed to detect earth's motion has failed.

the michelson-morley experiment (1887) attempted to measure earth's movement through space. the result? no motion detected.

instead of questioning the model, mainstream science invented ""relativity"" to explain why the experiment didn’t match expectations. when real-world results contradict their theories, they rewrite the theories instead of adjusting the model.

have you ever stopped to ask:

if earth is truly moving, why is there no direct, measurable proof?

all space agencies repeat the same story – but who controls them?
every time someone questions nasa, defenders say:

🔵 “other space agencies would expose the lie if it were fake!”

would they? or are they all controlled by the same global elite?

🔹 nasa (usa)
🔹 roscosmos (russia)
🔹 esa (europe)
🔹 jaxa (japan)
🔹 isro (india)
🔹 cnsa (china)

📌 they all share data.
📌 they all reinforce the same heliocentric model.
📌 they all use the same cgi-style images.

just like mainstream media outlets push the same narratives globally, every space agency repeats the same story.

if a country like russia or china exposed nasa’s lies, they would gain massive power and credibility. yet no one does.

why?

why do they use mockery & censorship instead of debate?
if earth is a globe and nasa is 100% truthful, they should welcome scrutiny. but instead, here’s how they respond:

📌 they mock: “haha, you think the earth is flat? you must be stupid.”
📌 they censor: youtube, google, reddit, and mainstream media bury or delete content questioning space.
📌 they attack: instead of disproving arguments, they insult and ridicule people who ask questions.

real science encourages questioning, debate, and independent verification. but when it comes to space and earth’s shape, they tell you to stop asking questions.

that alone should make you suspicious.

the real reason for the deception
if the truth about earth’s true nature were exposed, it would destroy the narratives controlled by nasa, the global elite, and academic institutions.

📌 if earth is not a spinning ball, then nasa is a fraud.
📌 if earth is the center of creation, then the big bang is a lie.
📌 if space is a hoax, then we have been deceived about our significance.

keeping people trapped in a false model of reality makes them easier to control. it ensures they trust scientists and government officials instead of their own senses.

so, ask yourself:
🔎 why are there no real, unedited images of earth?
🔎 why can’t we return to the moon with modern technology?
🔎 why does every experiment designed to prove earth's motion fail?
🔎 why do all space agencies repeat the exact same narrative?
🔎 why do they use censorship and mockery instead of open discussion?

maybe the truth is far different from what we’ve been told.

let’s have a real discussion
this isn’t about pushing an agenda—this is about asking questions we should all be allowed to ask.

📌 if you believe the official story, can you answer these questions without using nasa links or insults?
📌 if you have doubts, what evidence woke you up?
📌 if you still trust nasa, how do you reconcile these contradictions?

let’s keep this discussion civil, logical, and focused on real evidence.

if the truth is undeniable, then no question should be off-limits.

conspiracy,moon landings continue to be faked.,"i’m watching apollo 11 (2019) on hulu.   i’ve seen all of the evidence for and against the moon landings, and i have decided that we never put boots on the moon.  nasa lied to us.  

in “a funny thing happened on the way to the moon,” we are shown a clip of the apollo 11 astronauts faking a shot of the earth from 137 thousand miles out pretending to be halfway to the moon.  in the hulu special, that shot has been modernized and doctored with cgi.  i mean high definition.  the shot looks great.  they even cgi in a portion of the window even though the person holding the camera was sitting at least 10ft away from the window.  

you may also remember when neil armstrong set foot on the moon and said those iconic words, “that’s one small step for man... one giant leap for mankind.”  in the original footage, the camera is already on the moons surface.  this inspired people to say things like, “first person on the moon was neil armstrong’s camera men.”   in the hulu special, that iconic moment is shown with footage taken from inside the lem through a window.  funny how that changed.  

something that all moon hoax proponents agree on is that there should have been a blast crater from the rocket engine used to descend to the moon.  there was none.  in the hulu special, there is audio of neil armstrong calling attention to the fact that there is no crater under the lem like everyone thought there would be.

you may also remember when neil armstrong set foot on the moon and said those iconic words, “that’s one small step for man... one giant leap for mankind.”  in the original footage, the camera is already on the moons surface.  this inspired people to say things like, “first person on the moon was neil armstrong’s camera men.”   in the hulu special, that iconic moment is shown with footage taken from inside the lem through a window.  funny how that changed.  

something that all moon hoax proponents agree on is that there should have been a blast crater from the rocket engine used to descend to the moon.  there was none.  in the hulu special, there is audio of neil armstrong calling attention to the fact that there is no crater under the lem like everyone thought there would be.  

the hulu special is a very good watch for anyone who believes mankind has walked on the moon.  for everyone who has gone down this rabbit hole,  the hulu special confirms our suspicions that we never went to the moon.","['moon', 'landing', 'continue', 'faked', 'watching', 'apollo', 'hulu', 'ive', 'seen', 'evidence', 'moon', 'landing', 'decided', 'never', 'put', 'boot', 'moon', 'nasa', 'lied', 'funny', 'thing', 'happened', 'way', 'moon', 'shown', 'clip', 'apollo', 'astronaut', 'faking', 'shot', 'earth', 'thousand', 'mile', 'pretending', 'halfway', 'moon', 'hulu', 'special', 'shot', 'modernized', 'doctored', 'cgi', 'mean', 'high', 'definition', 'shot', 'look', 'great', 'even', 'cgi', 'portion', 'window', 'even', 'though', 'person', 'holding', 'camera', 'sitting', 'least', 'away', 'window', 'may', 'also', 'remember', 'neil', 'armstrong', 'set', 'foot', 'moon', 'said', 'iconic', 'word', 'thats', 'one', 'small', 'step', 'man', 'one', 'giant', 'leap', 'mankind', 'original', 'footage', 'camera', 'already', 'moon', 'surface', 'inspired', 'people', 'say', 'thing', 'like', 'first', 'person', 'moon', 'neil', 'armstrong', 'camera', 'men', 'hulu', 'special', 'iconic', 'moment', 'shown', 'footage', 'taken', 'inside', 'lem', 'window', 'funny', 'changed', 'something', 'moon', 'hoax', 'proponent', 'agree', 'blast', 'crater', 'rocket', 'engine', 'used', 'descend', 'moon', 'none', 'hulu', 'special', 'audio', 'neil', 'armstrong', 'calling', 'attention', 'fact', 'crater', 'lem', 'like', 'everyone', 'thought', 'would', 'hulu', 'special', 'good', 'watch', 'anyone', 'belief', 'mankind', 'walked', 'moon', 'everyone', 'gone', 'rabbit', 'hole', 'hulu', 'special', 'confirms', 'suspicion', 'never', 'went', 'moon']"

conspiracy,"the reason why india needed a ""moon landing""","i'm sure we've all seen that obviously fake video of the indian ""moon landing,"" which looks like a blender 3d modeling tutorial from 2008.

why did this fake moon landing happen specifically in india, though?

i believe it's because they have the largest hindu population in the world, a religion which presents a detailed cosmology (thousands of pages of specific descriptions) nearly identical to what we're coming to understand about the true nature of antarctica, the lies about space, disclosure, etc.

they needed a moon landing over there because most of their population is raised maybe not believing the vedic cosmology, but knowing it intimately. tptb needed to reinforce the space narrative in their heads, and the indian population gobbled it right up because of the nationalist fervor going on right now. 

narendra modhi is the leader of the bjp, which is the party of hindu nationalism (hindutva). it's essentially equivalent trump coming out and strongly reinforcing that lee harvey oswald was the shooter or that we emphatically did land on the moon. his followers will gobble it up regardless of their previous beliefs.

if you haven't familiarized yourself with the third reich's interesting relationship with india and tibet, nicholas roerich's usa sponsored missions to tibet, ahnenerbe, and basically wwii in general, you'll start to see my point of view on this. 

essentially, the germans found learned/some shit over there that revolutionized technology and the direction of the world. there was literally an arms race for tibet between germany, the soviets, and usa that very few people, even conspiracyheads like us know too much about. i realize this part is controversial, but i think the germans were a rogue agent tptb did not have full control over, so they freaked out, brought the entire world crashing down on germany's head, and then quietly stole the technology germany had discovered. the last part is indisputable as you know, with operation paperclip.

conspiracy,the moon landing was faked and here’s why.,"1. russia was the 1st into space with sputnik in 1957. america launched explorer 1 into space in 1958. america didnt give up and say “well the soviet union beat us into space” they can have it. no they launched into space a year later. 

2. we have a “international space station”. it’s not a “international moon station”. 

3. america supposedly sent 12 men to the moon with the last mission being 1966. with 4 men still alive. out of 195 nations in the world your telling me only america landed men on the moon? it’s been 56 years. statistically speaking that’s fucking impossible that no one has the drive to go to the moon in 56 years? come on man.

only two options exist:

1. we faked the moon landings for political gain over the russians. 

2. we went to the moon and the aliens told us to fuck off or else. 

number two is the only option that makes sense. because 195 nations and 56 years have gone by with no nations performing the same feet. yet we have thousands of satellites in space and enough space shit to form our own artificial saturn like rings around the earth. someone else already claimed the moon as there property and forced the governments of the world to stay the fuck off.

the vile social media post was shared to [lady victoria hervey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/lady_victoria_hervey)'s followers alongside a screenshot of the news that the 41-year-old trafficking victim had died.

ms giuffre was one of the most prominent accusers of convicted sex offenders epstein and ghislaine maxwell, who she said kept her as a sex slave while flying her around the world and offering to their powerful associates 'like a platter of fruit'.

she alleged they trafficked her to the duke of york when she was 17 and was three times sexually assaulted by him - a claim which prince andrew has denied. the prince reached an out-of-court settlement with her in 2022.

lady victoria, who had a brief fling with the prince, reacted to the news saying: 'when lies catch up to you there's no way out.'

a second story, two hours later, added: 'i have taken the decision to pause my posts on virginia giuffre at this time. 

'irrespective of the circumstances, suicide in anyone at any time is tragic, and in a young mother who has children, even more so.'

but she is yet to delete her initial statement - which has now been live on her page for seven hours. 

lady victoria was perhaps best known for a brief fling with prince andrew before quitting the uk for hollywood, where she secured a small part in a tom hanks movie.

the socialite has since made a name for herself as a cheerleader for donald trump and a public defender of her royal ex.

claiming she is a 'truth warrior', she has been branded a conspiracy theorist for claiming covid vaccines were part of a plot orchestrated by bill gates to ‘depopulate the world’.

she also has other theories about 9/11, jfk’s assassination and the moon landings.

reacting with fury after her post, social media users branded her a 'sick', while another said it was 'despicable'.

lady victoria claims prince andrew was 'set up' after an 'organised attack on the royal family', and launched a social media attack on ms giuffre, who won a multi-million pound settlement from prince andrew following claims she had been forced to have sex with him three times at the age of 17 when she was trafficked by his friend epstein.

andrew repeatedly denied her allegations and has said he can't recall ever meeting her, although a photograph of them together in a london townhouse, his arm around her bare midriff, was included in giuffre's lawsuit against him. 

she insisted ms giuffre's credibility had been 'destroyed' after she was released from hospital following a dramatic claim that she had only 'four days' to live after a car crash in australia. 

critics slammed the former socialite as ‘nasty’ and ‘vile’ after her brutal instagram post in which she shared ms giuffre’s selfie of herself with a badly bruised face and claiming that she was about to die from kidney failure with the word ‘karma’. 

it was accompanied by the soundtrack of europe’s 1986 hit the final countdown to mock her claims.

she later told mailonline that ms giuffre was a 'fantasist' who was faking or exaggerating the seriousness of her condition in order to 'emotionally blackmail' her children who appear to be with her estranged husband.
