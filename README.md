Assignment 2 Group 15 repository
Group_15_code.ipynb file contains majority of the code from data collection to part 1 of community detection and analysis. This notebook will create files such as reddit_posts.csv, reddit_comments.csv, reddit_reply_network.graphml, top_users_reply_graph.graphml and louvain_top_users_reply_graph.graphml when run. constrain_scores_code.ipynb and community_detection.ipynb can be ran after reddit_posts.csv and reddit_comments.csv have been created and then run independantly.

The time sheet file contains a pdf with a table that shows how each of the members distributed the tasks and contributed to the total project over the 4 weeks.

The data sample contains two csv files(sample_data_posts.csv and sample_data_comments.csv) that have the top 100 posts and comments from the posts_df and comments_df respectively, which we fetched from reddit in group_15_code.ipynb.
