1726634889,moon two earth get,"Earth getting TWO moons?!?! Why no one is talking about this?

Anyway, an asteroid named 2024 PT5 is going to be our 2nd moon for 53 days starting from September 29 to November 25.

Now the explanation for this is - It's the phenomenon when some flying asteroids or space rocks are captured in the earth's gravitational field. 

But that's not all. It had also happened before: 

Previously, it also happened 2 times: from July 2006 to July 2007, there was another asteroid like this, and when it departed in 2007, guess what started:  a financial crisis with 2008 at its peak.

2nd case is also of another minimoon in Earth's orbit for several years, only to depart in 2020. Guess what started then?

There are many predictions about such events in ancient culture like-

The Hopi culture, has predictions about celestial events— The appearance of twins in the sky before great destruction.

( Twins could also hint about the appearance of another celestial object behaving in the same manner.)

This is the third time we're having a minimoon, and no one is talking about it!"
1732116851,moon ancient exist time,"The Moon did not exist in Ancient Times? Talbots ‘Saturn Myth’ book puts forward a very Interesting hypothesis that the Moon, like our current ‘Sol’, simply did not exist in Ancient/BC times. Many Ancient cultures, from Aborigines to the Sumerian’s and Egyptians, describe the Moon being ‘bought into place’ as if guided by some entity or force.

It would have proved a very spectacular site, if it were true. There are allegedly heaps of evidence to back this up, of which I am trying to locate. Have you guys ever come across any research papers, books or evidence regarding this theory?

I would be keen to hear your thoughts on this, regardless. It’s fascinating :)"
1704238049,peopl defens moon question land get whi,"Why do people get so defensive when the 1969 Moon Landing is questioned? Whenever a Moon Landing conspiracy is posted to this sub, the comments are always calling out how insane and crazy not believing in it is, how it's ""easier to actually go to the moon than to fake it"" (a bullshit statement that gets peddled too much). People act as if not believing in the moon landing is one of the more wackier conspiracies such as believing the Earth is flat or that lizards rule us. I saw someone post on the space subreddit about their father being a moon landing denier and the comments were calling him a degenerate and for the user to cut ties with him...What? Is it that out there to not believe it happened?

Between it happening in the 60s with technology that had less input power than a calculator, humans never going back despite every other piece of technology advancing throughout these last 60 years, the Van Allen belt, Fuel capacity, suspicious photography, NASA being led by a Nazi at the time, awkward astronauts at the press conference looking like they just got away with a crime...all back in the 60s before DVDs and the internet was even invented, I can see why some question it.

I think it's an American Pride thing. The propaganda was at an extreme level when it happened in the 60s and some don't have it in them to think that maybe it could have been fake. Especially on a site like reddit where Space exploration is pushed hard. So I'd like to ask, on an emotional level, would the lunar landing being fake deeply upset some of you?

1713801438,moon flimsi multipl nasa lunar lander time fli,"How did NASA fly to the Moon multiple times with that flimsy Lunar Lander? The Lunar Lander looks like a child's school project put together with materials bought from Michaels:

* aluminum foil
* construction paper
* scotch tape
* cardboard
* sculpting wire
* zip ties
* paper clips
* rubber bands
* duct tape
* elmers glue

It looks like if you fart loud enough that you can even damage that Lunar Lander with a hefty fart after eating a can of beans.

Apparently that flimsy Lunar Lander did a perfect landing on the Moon's surface multiple times without any structural damage whatsoever.

None of the construction paper tore off, none of that cool aluminum foil wrapping came off, none of those thin twig legs bent or broke apart, etc.

Its structural integrity remains completely unscathed after numerous landings on the Moon's surface.

Has anyone noticed this when looking at these photos? Just looking at it makes me laugh out loud."
1727367650,ha moon man nation sent whi,"Why has no other nation sent a Man to the Moon? In the 1960s NASA sent a Man to the Moon about a dozen times.Okay but since then almost 70 years later why has no other nation sent a Man to the Moon? For example China or Russia or India or Japan, etc neither of those powerful countries have sent a Man to the Moon. Yes they all send those fragile little rover toys up into space but why do they not even try to send a Man to the Moon? They do not even attempt to do it let alone actually achieve that goal. You know what I mean? Wouldn't each of those nations want to put their own Flag up on the Moon as a great achievement? The puzzling thing about the Moon Mystery is no nation even attempts to go up there and put their Man on the Moon. It's like they all deemed it impossible and don't even try.......

1715806415,never moon nasa back went come,"If NASA went to the Moon in the 1960s, how come they never went back again? So NASA went to the Moon in the 1960s about a dozen times, but everything they filmed was grainy and low quality with bad quality cameras. How come with the invention of the modern 4K High Definition cameras they never thought let's go back and film some awesome footage on the Moon in 4K HD? Do they all of a sudden not care about the Moon anymore? Detractors say there is nothing to see on the Moon and they already saw everything in the 1960s. How can they say that when it was all so poorly filmed back then with low quality cameras.

People want to see beautiful 60 FPS 4K HD videos of the Moon's craters and surface with astronauts jumping around in real time nowadays. I am puzzled as to why NASA does not care about going back to the Moon and now they say they do not have the telemetry data and knowledge and deleted all the files and have no clue how to fly back to the Moon. How come they have no interest in going back and say they do not even remember how to go back and need to start from scratch? Can anyone explain this?"
1729164813,hell go,"What the hell is going on! A dangerous Venezuelan gang has taken over at least four apartment complexes in San Antonio, Texas, as it expands its reach in yet another America city, DailyMail can reveal.

Dubbed the 'epitome of evil', [**Tren de Aragua (TdA)**](https://www.foxnews.com/us/who-tren-de-aragua-vicious-venezuelan-gang-following-path-ms-13-america) is known to run drug smuggling, child prostitution and human trafficking rings in South America, with its members crossing over into the US in recent years amid a wave of Venezuelan migrants. 

The tattooed mobsters have since unleashed a wave of crime across the country from [**Miami**](https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/2-venezuela-gang-members-accused-of-doral-murder-face-death-penalty/3413428/?amp=1) and [**Texas**](https://www.foxnews.com/us/texas-gov-abbott-designates-venezuelan-gang-tren-de-aragua-foreign-terrorist-organization.amp) to [**Denver**](https://nypost.com/2024/10/14/us-news/aurora-landlord-says-tren-de-aragua-took-over-apartment-tried-to-extort-them/) and [**New York**](https://www.fox5ny.com/news/nyc-crime-venezuelan-gang-tren-de-aragua-nypd.amp).

Just last week a small army of police officers raided an apartment complex in San Antonio and arrested 19 individuals - including four gang members.

Law enforcement sources confirmed TdA had been operating at the Palatia Apartments for five to six months - squatting in empty units they either rented out to other migrants, used as a base to deal cocaine or, most horrifically, as prostitution dens to pimp out women and children.

But now DailyMail can reveal that this apartment invasion is just the tip of the iceberg in the major southern Texas city, with at least three other rental properties also occupied by the criminal organization. - [**Source**](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/texas/article-13958241/amp/texas-gang-tren-aragua-apartment-complex-raid.html)"

1729058058,talk rapidli chang nobodi solar system,"Our Solar System is changing rapidly, and nobody is talking about it All the major bodies of our Solar System are changing rapidly, but nobody is talking about it. We are seeing rapid observable climate changes occurring on almost every single planet:

1. Pluto's atmosphere has recently collapsed
2. Neptune's storms have suddenly begun rotating backwards
3. Uranus' polar regions have been visibly flaring
4. Jupiter has recently experienced a 700 degree temperature impulse originating from its northern pole, and its great red spot is fading
5. Mars is suddenly displaying seismic activity
6. Our own polar regions have warmed drastically recently, the amount of volcanic activity we are seeing is at an all-time high
7. Venus's planetary winds have increased their velocity by 33% in the last 20 years

It goes on from there, we've recently observed:

1. large-scale changes in the ice cover on Jupiter’s moon Europa
2. large-scale changes in the polar ice cap on Mars
3. a large-scale decrease in atmospheric pressure on Venus
4. a mysterious brightening of the atmosphere of Saturn
5. a mysterious darkening of the atmosphere of Venus
6. unusual changes in the temperature and pressure of the atmosphere of Neptune
7. a brightening of the atmosphere of Jupiter
8. a mysterious dark spot near the South Pole of Venus

Here on earth, our own magnetosphere is rapidly losing it's strength as our magnetic poles continue to race away from their usual positions, wreaking havoc on animal migrations - see all the beached whales over the last couple years as well as a spike in reports of unusual bird migrations.

Things have gotten to the point where we are now updating our magnetic models yearly, and soon there will be zones of flux broken bad enough to cause real danger to flying due to constant magnetic reconnection.

Our aurorae are reaching record levels of intensity, with aurorae colorations indicating very high energy intensities being observed.

The fundamental electromagnetic nature of this planet is changing rapidly.

Electromagnetism is responsible for a variety of effects on living creatures, most especially cardiac and pulmonary health in humans.

Volcanic activity on our planet is currently at a record, with more and more volcanoes showing concerning lift, erupting, or showing increases in lava flow. Every single active volcano along the pacific rim is showing increased activity. 

Given only one of two data points, it woulud be easy to discount the events as isolated and unrelated outliers with no significance.

Taken together, however, the total body of evidence becomes impossible to ignore, and, once the presumption is made that this information is known by our leaders, pretty much explains the motivations for their actions.

Everything is changing. Nobody is telling you. In fact, they built us a world where these questions are taboo, where every answer leads you away from the glaring, obvious truth - that we live on a planet subject to cyclical cataclysms. Those in power know the next cataclysm is coming soon and have been preparing for a long time. It's just that their plans don't include us.

“We’ll know our disinformation program is complete when everything the American public believes is false.” William Casey, former director of the CIA, upon being asked what the goal of the agency was (in 1981).

1708862170,conspiraci mushroom biggest,"The biggest conspiracy of all is the mushroom conspiracy 
 Here’s why:  

1. Stoned ape theory. Why is this not more popular? I think it makes a lot of sense actually.    

2. You can only buy one type of mushroom (at most stores) and they even call it different names (portobello, button, baby bella, crimini) these are all the same mushroom. To me it looks like they are trying to deceive us by making it look like we have variety when we don’t.    

3. Mushrooms really are medicine. They are full of nutrients and everyone is scared of them.    

4. The best medicine we have is antibiotics and it comes from fungus. Why wouldn’t other fungus fight other bacteria’s and viruses? Well they do. People aren’t educated about them and fear them.    

5. Mycologists believe the entire earths crust is covered in mycelium. Sometimes I wonder if they are responsible for the evolution of all things; if they make planets living if you will. We should send them to Mars and Venus and the moon.     

6. Even the rain needs mushrooms. The clouds can’t hold water without enough debris and the majority of that debris is spores.    

7. Every breath you take has spores. These things are very significant…    

8. In ancient China and ancient Egypt mushrooms were only for royalty commoners were punished for having them.    

9. On the Joe Rogan show with Paul stamets, Paul had to stop the conversation when joe was prying for info on portobello mushrooms, and he said, “I can’t talk about this because I could get killed”     

10. The oldest mushroom fossil dates back 800 million to a billion years old….these things are incredibly evolved and don’t even need to have sex (and they even look like a penis when they spread their “seed”). You can break them apart and more will grow and faster. This is even a cultivation method. To put you in perspective, we only date back around 300,000 years.

11. I have been making my own extracts for a while now and I have been blowing my own mind with how much better my life has gotten since I started eating these and foraging and using them on my face and everything. Chanterelles, puffballs, boletes, honey mushrooms,     

12. A lot of people believe you can travel to different planets and areas in space when you eat psychedelic mushrooms.     

13. There are fungi in the rainforest that target specific animals when they get too overpopulated and balance out the nature so to say    

14. Maria Sabina is a Mexican shaman who gave mushrooms to celebrities and royalty once westerners discovered them for enlightenment. The Beatles and Rockefeller even got mushrooms from her.    

15. I fasted on foraged mushrooms for 2 months and pooped out dead pin worms. This happened 4 years ago. This makes me think about the scene in the matrix where Neo gets bugged. Metaphorically the red pill work well synonymously.    

16. There are mushroom cave paintings around the world depicting bulls and mushrooms on the ground. Could this imply that they ate mushrooms and became artistic and were explaining that?    

17. There are pictures of Jesus with mushrooms in stained glass windows at very popular historic churches around the world.    

18. lion’s mane mushroom and reishi mushroom are sold as nootropic supplements. the 5000 year old mummified corpse Ötzi was found in the alps in the 90s with Piptoporus betulinus attached to his belt. it may have been used as medicine.    

19.LSD is also a fungus-derived drug made with ergotamine. ergotamine comes from Claviceps fungus.    

20. ergotamine is also used in a migraine medicine called cafergot. it was obsoleted in the 90s with the introduction of sumatriptan but it still works for many people.    

21. If you look up why psilocybin exists, the popular consensus is that it’s a poison to keep bugs and animals away. What I’ve seen is that they love that shit.I have seen families of centipedes come out from inside them. I have seen plenty of fire ant colony’s build their ant hill over a turd a day after I picked giant mushrooms out of it. Squirrels eat them. Snails love them. Everyone knows the nat flys love them.    

22. The fact that they call the brain the “default mode network” when you become an adult and so little of your brain is lit up under an mri. But if you look at an adult on mushrooms or a child under an mri the whole brain is lit up. The creepy part is how they try to normalize it with the wording “default mode network”    

23. Cordycept mushrooms take over the minds of insects and are parasitic to the insect. Paul stamets developed a way to rid termites forever and it is not used because it solves the problem completely.  I sometimes wonder if psychedelic mushrooms are a symbiotic relationship when we eat them 🤷‍♂️     

24. It is illegal to possess psychedelic mushrooms but not deathcaps or destroying angels. What is the real agenda here is it really safety?    

25. Im saying that big pharma is part of the mushroom conspiracy because they are the answer to big pharma. One time I asked my doctor about mushrooms as medicine and he said, “have I heard of it? Im a victim of it!” I thought that was very strange I still have no explanation.  

If life is a test I don’t think it’s a test how well we can listen to people. Maybe there is something special with them. Maybe we can listen and learn from them.     Does anyone agree with this? Let me know your thoughts. Please help share this post."

1705843220,wa moon ancient accord numer exist sky time account,"According To Numerous Ancient Accounts, There Was A Time When The Moon Did Not Exist In The Sky  **In ancient writings and traditions one can find proof of a time when the moon did not exist. Democretus and Anaxagoras mention that there was a time when no moon could be seen in the night skies. In describing the history of the Greek region of Arcadia, Aristotle writes that the Pelasgians lived in the area since very old times; at a time when the moon did not exist.** 

 Apollonios from Rhodes mentions something similar; he talks about a time when not all of the celestial objects existed in the sky; before the time of Deucalion’s and Pyrra’s generation (before the cataclysm); when the moon did not exist and the only humans that existed were the Pelasgians living on the mountains of Arcadia (region in Greece). These inhabitants of Arcadia where also known as Proselenes (meaning “those that were before moon” in Greek).  

In Plutarch’s work “Morals” we find the following: “There were Arcadians of Evander’s following, the so-called pre-Lunar people.”

Similarly, Ovid wrote: “The Arcadians are said to have possessed their land before the birth of Zeus, and the folk is older than the Moon.”

 

Stephanus of Byzantium wrote: “Arcadians and females, both exist before the moon”. Hippolytus refers to a legend that “Arcadia brought forth Pelasgus, of greater antiquity than the moon.”

Lukianos in his Astrology says that “the Arcadians affirm in their folly that they are older than the moon”.

Evidence has also been found in other parts of the world. In Bolivia symbols on the wall of the courtyard of Kalasasaya (built in 13,000 BC) provide evidence that the moon came into orbit around the Earth at a specific moment in time thousands of years ago, long before what mainstream historians refer to as recorded history.

What is interesting about this is that there is the TV studio commentary and explained beforehand and a crazy animation of the landing itself (not the films we have all seen) but the most fascinating part is that we see Armstrong and Aldrin getting off the lunar lander as it was seen by millions of people.

What most people do not know however was that this isn't the video feed we are seeing. In fact the video feed was connected to a video monitor, which was then filmed by another camera and then that feed was projected on to a wall (you can see that projection in videos of mission control) and it is THAT PROJECTION that was filmed by the TV station and broadcast.

1735272103,fake idea yield concern you'v sibrel' owen stop candac told confess bart moon land,"Concerning the Moon landing, don't stop at Bart Sibrel's confession to Candace Owens; it being fake. Yield to the idea that the Moon isn't what you've been told it is. On December 20th, Candace had Bart on her podcast explaining how the Moon landing was faked. Don't stop there. The Moon isn't what you think it is. I made a post about the true nature of the Moon a while back, but it failed to gain traction in r/conspiracy. I posted it in the proper community as well, but it was removed because they insist on believing in ferries. Nobody ever went to the Moon and nobody ever will. I'll repost my evidence.

  
""First off, observation of phenomena is fundamental to belief. I accept an orb silently fleeting towards the horizon as true because I know somebody very close to me who's seen it. I never saw it, but I did see something else. After googling what I saw, I found few results.

  
(…)

  
I'll describe the phenomenon. The Moon shakes, visibly. Don't take my word for it; take somebody else's. 'I got out of the car and the moon was moving left, right, up, down, all over the place for a short amount of time. It was freaky as hell.' This is a good description. The Moon doesn't always move like this though, otherwise the phenomenon would be more widely reported. No worthwhile explanation can be found for what was observed. I'll go through all of the so-called explanations I came across.

  
Apparently, NASA & Co. think two things are happening, but moon-quakes wouldn't cause visible shakes and libration (often termed wobble) is a slow process. These are not the case.

  
The most robust explanation in the eyes of those who never saw it is something along the lines of atmospheric turbulence. Supposedly, moonlight bends/refracts when it passes through various layers of air at different temperatures and densities. An example of this is a star twinkling. By definition, a twinkle is a rapid change in brightness. This sounds like what you see when you look at a star, but not the phenomenon observed. Another example given is a coin at the bottom of a fountain. This rippling effect is wavelike and in no way represents the observation. The last example of this is similar to the previous one. It ultimately involves some form of heat wave, but this is akin to a mirage. I've seen mirages. This was not a mirage. The Moon's disk/saucer is clear and it shifts entirely from one place to another.

  
The last explanation is in the eyes of those who saw the phenomenon. One individual supposes involuntary eye movements to be the likely cause and suggests that something stable should've been in the line of sight between the observer and the Moon to confirm its movement. This is exactly what I did and the movement persisted. By the way, there was definitely no earthquake. Another individual mentions the brightness of the Moon and its contrast to the darkness of the night sky as something difficult for the eyes to fix on. This is demonstrably false, by looking at the Moon when it seems to be stable. An illusion was brought forward by another person who referred to it as autokinesis. I know the autokinetic effect because I've experienced it. It also has nothing to do with the observation.

  
Alas, no credible explanation was found.

  
I'll leave you with this. If the Moon is the satellite of Earth, it shouldn't act like somebody accidentally hit its projector. Historically, there are accounts of the Sun moving erratically in the sky too, but that's material for a different post. My dictionary has the word earthshaking as another term for world-shattering and goes on to define it as 'loud enough to shake the very earth.' Could sound/vibration be the cause? Regardless, if the Moon's identity is questionable and it's arguably flying, should we not think of it as a UFO?""

1719671100,strong discuss devil moment wanna advoc believ one someth let play convers moon land real,"Let’s have a ""what if"" conversation. I’m one strong believer that the Moon landing is real but I wanna play Devil’s advocate for a moment and discuss something here. I’ve seen countless interviews of the poor Astronauts being harassed by journalists and people who don’t believe in the Moon landing and stuff – and I’ve also seen some astronauts break down when asked simple questions and getting to the point of them simply saying: ""I don’t know what I saw"" basically; and acting very confused or like they don’t know where they are and they sort of have a total mental shutdown or breakdown in front of cameras. 

I’m thinking that – if we took as a hypothetical for a moment the crazy theory that the Moon landing somehow never happened – I think that for these astronauts to be so keen on believing and even going as far as swearing that they walked on the Moon; I think that the only logical explanation is that they were hypnotized and kept under the effects of heavy drugs for the entire time while they were faking the Moon-landing movies and tapes – and so the Astronauts who were basically shooting the videos in a movie studio as paid actors actually believed that they were really on the Moon while shooting these videos – and that they were really walking on the surface of the Moon; which would explain why so many years later they still have memory losses or they’re just uncertain about what they saw and some really don’t wanna talk about it because after years they started developing many self-doubts and their memory began to sort of collapse on itself since their mind often draws blanks and there’s whole chunks of memories missing and generally speaking a lot of confusion in them – because they were under the effects of heavy drugs when they experienced those things.

They’re just as confused as the people who interviewed them when they came back from the Apollo 11 mission to be honest, so we shouldn’t be harsh on them even if the whole thing turned out to be a fake. They’re victims just like the public would be if it turned out that the whole thing was a hoax. But their mental and physical state even nowadays could only be explained by the fact that their minds underwent severe trauma and they were basically drugged and conditioned into believing that what they were experiencing was real. 

This doesn’t mean that they didn’t go to space though – they totally went to space. But the Moon stuff could have been shot on earth and they only gave the astronauts the mental illusion that they were actually on the Moon; which is why so many are convinced that they really went there and they’re even ready to swear it.

This video of Kamala shows the US governments commitment to hurricane victims.

There are all kinds of videos going around stating that FEMA is blocking aid, and not allowing volunteers to go and rescue victims of Hurricane Helene. There's one person who stated he would be ""arrested"" for using his helicopter to go save victims of this hurricane.

I believe that the fires in Mauii were caused by a DEW attack, and the extreme hurricanes we are seeing on the East Coast of USA are caused by cloud seeding and weather manipulation. This is why climate change has been shoved down everyone's throat for so long now, it's preemptive programming so all these extreme weather events seem normal/natural, when in reality they have been artificially generated. what would be the reason for governments to do this? of course you can argue for the lithium, or for the land in Mauii, however, it could also be a new world order strategy for depopulation - create disasters and pretend like it's ""climate change"" Whatever the true reason for it I don't know, but I believe these weather events are artificially created. Films like ""Leave the World behind"" are preemptive programming as well. Obama once said to someone I know who is involved in politics, ""If you want to hide the truth, put it in a film"". Films like ""They Cloned Tyronne"" hide actual government cover-ups and disguise them as ""comedic fiction"". It's honestly a brilliant strategy, hide the truth in plain sight.

And for anyone who wants to tell me ""trust the science"" of climate change, here's what happens to scientists who discover/study/bring light to science they aren't supposed to, such as zero point energy or anti-gravity tech, which already exist. I've seen ORBs defy the laws of physics IRL, the same size as the ORBS from the MH370 plane video. These technologies already exist, but if you prove it to humanity you end up like one of these people on this list.

My point is simply that humanity is being manipulated and deceived about so many things, climate change is just one of many examples of lies which are used to manipulate our species and guide us into a pre-planned future. I say all this as someone who has seen 4 up close UFO's, all which defied the laws of physics, so I know there is technology that exists which humanity is being kept in the dark about. I have also seen 2 shapeshifters, believe it or not, I don't really care, I'm just being honest and transparent. Whatever all this is about (Illuminate, reptiles, greys, etc.) what seems to be extremely apparent is that we as a species are being manipulated by secret societies. We are constantly being guided into pre-determined events, such as COVID, Mauii, The genocide in Gaza, and now Hurricane Helene and Milton. these are not events are not random, they are pre-planned by secret societies. I don't know what the solution is, but I think we as a species should start by being realistic and understand that DEW's, Zero Point Energy, Anti-Gravity Technology - all these concepts are real, you just can't prove it or you will be killed. (cloud seeding is an exception because it is admittedly/proven to be real)."
1731103952,conspiraci parti lost democrat,"The Conspiracy of the Democratic Party and How We Lost I've been a Democrat my whole life. When I was little my mom, who was active in the party, would take me to rallys and various events.  When I grew up I loved PBS, Democracy Now, Keith Oberman, etc. Never watched fox news in my life. Pretty much everyone in my life was a Democrat, with a few exceptions, and with them we just didn't discuss politics.

I've contributed to various campaigns and helped build voting blocks. In short, I loved  the party.

My values are and always have been:

* Anti-War
* Pro free speech / anti censorship
* Distrust of major intuitions and some government agencies
* Pro bodily autonomy
* Openness, tolerance, live and let live
* Meritocracy
* Anti big Pharma
* Support of ""the little guy"" and main street
* Pro-family
* Pro Science

And pretty much every democrat I know in person holds similar values, and (I thought) the party itself.

In the 2000s  I saw the Bush administration as corrupt war criminals, the worst of the worst. (And I still do). Warmongers who lied to entangle us in conflict for 2 decades.

I voted for Obama twice, but during his 2nd term I started to realize he didn't fulfill any of his campaign promises and basically continued most of the Bush policies. He even droned American citizens without a trial. 

I was a big Bernie supported and contributed his campaign, then I watched how my party attacked him and rigged the primary. Then I watched him, after a year of him telling us how evil Hillary was, endorse her and tell us how great she was. I started watching my fellow democrats, the media, and politicians become increasingly intolerant, divisive, and begin to violate the values I listed above. I started to feel uneasy.

Then Trump ran, which I thought was insane, and I bought into what was said about him at first. 

One day I was flying across country and on a layover in a midwest airport I picked up a magazine, USA Today, or Newsweek, or one of those. Trump was on the cover shaking hands with some world leader and it said ""Trump negotiates with so and so on XYZ"". I didn't think much of it. Then that evening I landed in California and was walking through the airport and saw the same magazine, but the cover was different. This time the cover showed Trump looking mean and glowering over the world leader, not shaking hands. The headline said ""Trump intimidates so and so"". That's t he first time I felt something was wrong. Here was the same publication, on the same day, same story, two different parts of the country, two very different vibes. When this happened, I decided to really pay attention and question what I was seeing. 

I saw a video of Trump saying ""Muslims, we don't want them in our country"" and I thought ""Wow, that's a pretty bigoted take, I can't support that"". And all over the media I saw my favorite talking heads decrying this and calling him a hateful racist, and rightly so. But, because of the above, I decided to seek out a full, uncut video and a transcript. What I saw shocked me. He said something like:

""There are great Muslims, doctors and scientists, and we want them here. But there are other, radical Muslims. The kind that abuse women and throw gays off of buildings. We don't want them in our country.""

I realized with horror that what he said had been cut to make it look like exactly the opposite of what he was saying. After that I started doing this same analysis with everything I saw. My heart sank, issue after issue was a hoax, a malicious edit, or something else along those lines.

* The very fine people hoax. The Russia Collusion Hoax. The Bloodbath statement.

No one around me was doing this kind of analysis and looking into it, they were just accepting whatever was said. I think what happened was, the DNC adopted Karl Rove tactics and no one noticed.  I started to question and point these things out to the people around me and what I got in return was vicious attacks, name calling, and a refusal to look at the evidence. 

Then I watched my party actively screw over very (at least in my town) popular Democrats like Tulsi, RFK, even people like Andrew Yang and others. I watched us skip the primary altogether, lie about Biden's health, and then install Kamala, who no one wanted in the 2020 primary as the candidate and then run an appalling campaign that failed drastically. I watched us turn against many prominent liberal or moderate podcasters and demonize / lie about them, pushing them to the other side. 

Covid happened, and because of my job at the time, I had a lot of behind the scenes insight.  For example, my bosses wife who was a high up lawyer at the FDA involved with the emergency use authorization said the following when I asked her about the vax: ""Sometimes its necessary to lie to the American people in order to do what's financially expedient."" I was horrified to see how almost nazi my side became during that disaster. 

Then I saw my party push an agenda that was:

* Pro War
* Pro big business
* Pro big pharma
* Anti family
* Sexist
* Racist
* Pro censorship
* Anti bodily autonomy except for abortion
* Anti meritocracy
* Very intolerant and hateful
* Constantly appeal to big institution authority

The more I looked, researched, found uncut videos, full transcripts, read bills, read scientific studies directly, not summarized by media or facebook, the more I realized how angry, corrupt, and broken it all was. The more I realized I was being lied to all the time and that whatever I was a part of, didn't share my values any more. 

That is how I came to vote republican for the first time in my life this week. Not because I think the republicans are good, or because I think Trump will fix anything, but because after trying hard for several years, I can't see any way to try to bring my party back into integrity, honor and values. We HAD to lose. That was our only chance to be forced to introspect and reform and realign towards what the majority of people actually want out of a government, rather than a collection of weird, unpopular fringe positions pushed with lies and propaganda. 

Now it might be that there is no coming back, that we fell too far and wont be able to introspect and do the work necessary to fix it, I don't know. But I had to share this story because it is the story of so many people that I have talked to in person and online. That is how we lost, not because the majority of Americans are evil dumb racists. The majority of Americans are smart, reasonable, and generally want to do the right thing. But if we just continue to demonize 1/2 of our friends and neighbors we have no chance for a positive future. 

Many of the comments I'm going to get on this post will be attacking and hateful and that's ok, that just illustrates what I am trying to say.

Thanks for reading, and I hope we can all take a pause and evaluate how we got here. "

1726687992,distress disavow amelia later earhart island pacif navi make die day land call castaway,"Amelia Earhart landed on a Pacific island and died as a castaway, making distress calls for days that were later disavowed by the Navy.  Almost everyone subscribes to one of three theories about the Amelia Earhart flight:

* Crashed and sank
* Captured by the Japanese
* Landed and died as a castaway

The castaway theory is put forth by a research group named TIGHAR that has been working on it for over 35 years. It was the original theory that the Navy acted upon at the beginning of the search for Earhart (due to the distress calls and the direction finding of them, and because it made the most navigational sense), but when they failed to find the plane or it's occupants, the Navy disavowed the theory and deemed all the post-loss distress calls 'hoaxes', blaming Earhart herself for the tragedy in their final report.

TIGHAR has amassed a mountain of evidence that is both highly convincing and a riveting story - unfortunately, they haven't produced a physical plane part or a physical body part so many folks dismiss them. It is a mistake to do so. 

I'm convinced by the research and body of evidence presented by TIGHAR that the castaway theory is true. This is because I read through most of TIGHAR's documents which are scattered about on the highly disorganized [TIGHAR website](https://tighar.org). Most people don't bother to do this - they instead read what others say about TIGHAR second-hand in forums and then dismiss the theory as just another of the many crackpot theories about Earhart. 

If you don't know what I'm talking about, or if you do and have doubts about the TIGHAR theory, I challenge you to read Ric Gillespie's book ""One More Good Flight"" where the body of evidence is finally concentrated in one place - or if you don't wish to 'enrich' Gillespie then read the research on TIGHAR's [shitty website](https://tighar.org). Either way, if you actually read the evidence instead of the internet echo chamber, you'll likely come to the same conclusion I did."

How in the hell is there an israeli linked agency or citizen at all levels of our Federal Govt and parts of our State Govts? Now add in one of the biggest city LE agencies…

This one just blew my mind a little bit and kinda ironic if you believe the israel-911 stuff. 

But it would explain how the protests turned to chaos rather quickly considering the first protests were very mild and peaceful until provocations from LE came in. And add on that the fake news of a known ‘terrorist’ being in the crowd to stir up even more chaos. 

Now there seems to be your typical protesters from BLM and other recent liberal, communist or what ever name you can think of taking over these protests and harming the anti-war/ stop funding of israel message that it was started on initially. 

But, this whole thing is not going to end well at all.I’m afraid that the ‘culture war’ that’s been spoken about for decades is here in a new form around this and the ‘Leaders’ in DC are pushing forward to create a final power vacuum to erode our rights as ‘free’ people in the US with its justification. Without a real voice, who are we?

According to Israeli law, her conversion grants her the right to become an Israeli citizen and live there, while Palestinians who have lived in the region for millennia are denied this same right. Israel has taken land from those who have lived there for generations, offering it instead to anyone who converts to Judaism. However, if someone was Jewish 2,000 years ago but later converted to Christianity or Islam, their descendants today do not have the same claim to the land.

What is interesting about this is that there is the TV studio commentary and explained beforehand and a crazy animation of the landing itself (not the films we have all seen) but the most fascinating part is that we see Armstrong and Aldrin getting off the lunar lander as it was seen by millions of people.

What most people do not know however was that this isn't the video feed we are seeing. In fact the video feed was connected to a video monitor, which was then filmed by another camera and then that feed was projected on to a wall (you can see that projection in videos of mission control) and it is THAT PROJECTION that was filmed by the TV station and broadcast.

1735272103,fake idea yield concern you'v sibrel' owen stop candac told confess bart moon land,"Concerning the Moon landing, don't stop at Bart Sibrel's confession to Candace Owens; it being fake. Yield to the idea that the Moon isn't what you've been told it is. On December 20th, Candace had Bart on her podcast explaining how the Moon landing was faked. Don't stop there. The Moon isn't what you think it is. I made a post about the true nature of the Moon a while back, but it failed to gain traction in r/conspiracy. I posted it in the proper community as well, but it was removed because they insist on believing in ferries. Nobody ever went to the Moon and nobody ever will. I'll repost my evidence.

  
""First off, observation of phenomena is fundamental to belief. I accept an orb silently fleeting towards the horizon as true because I know somebody very close to me who's seen it. I never saw it, but I did see something else. After googling what I saw, I found few results.

  
(…)

  
I'll describe the phenomenon. The Moon shakes, visibly. Don't take my word for it; take somebody else's. 'I got out of the car and the moon was moving left, right, up, down, all over the place for a short amount of time. It was freaky as hell.' This is a good description. The Moon doesn't always move like this though, otherwise the phenomenon would be more widely reported. No worthwhile explanation can be found for what was observed. I'll go through all of the so-called explanations I came across.

  
Apparently, NASA & Co. think two things are happening, but moon-quakes wouldn't cause visible shakes and libration (often termed wobble) is a slow process. These are not the case.

  
The most robust explanation in the eyes of those who never saw it is something along the lines of atmospheric turbulence. Supposedly, moonlight bends/refracts when it passes through various layers of air at different temperatures and densities. An example of this is a star twinkling. By definition, a twinkle is a rapid change in brightness. This sounds like what you see when you look at a star, but not the phenomenon observed. Another example given is a coin at the bottom of a fountain. This rippling effect is wavelike and in no way represents the observation. The last example of this is similar to the previous one. It ultimately involves some form of heat wave, but this is akin to a mirage. I've seen mirages. This was not a mirage. The Moon's disk/saucer is clear and it shifts entirely from one place to another.

  
The last explanation is in the eyes of those who saw the phenomenon. One individual supposes involuntary eye movements to be the likely cause and suggests that something stable should've been in the line of sight between the observer and the Moon to confirm its movement. This is exactly what I did and the movement persisted. By the way, there was definitely no earthquake. Another individual mentions the brightness of the Moon and its contrast to the darkness of the night sky as something difficult for the eyes to fix on. This is demonstrably false, by looking at the Moon when it seems to be stable. An illusion was brought forward by another person who referred to it as autokinesis. I know the autokinetic effect because I've experienced it. It also has nothing to do with the observation.

  
Alas, no credible explanation was found.

  
I'll leave you with this. If the Moon is the satellite of Earth, it shouldn't act like somebody accidentally hit its projector. Historically, there are accounts of the Sun moving erratically in the sky too, but that's material for a different post. My dictionary has the word earthshaking as another term for world-shattering and goes on to define it as 'loud enough to shake the very earth.' Could sound/vibration be the cause? Regardless, if the Moon's identity is questionable and it's arguably flying, should we not think of it as a UFO?""

1728998779,thi way act food gaza say refus enter cnn unbeliev,"Food is refusing to enter Gaza, says CNN. Unbelievable that food acts this way. No food has entered northern Gaza since the start of October, putting 1 million people at risk of going hungry, the World Food Programme told CNN on Friday.

In August, approximately 700 hundred aid trucks entered northern Gaza. In September, only 400 aid trucks entered, after commercial operations ceased at the Allenby Crossing on the border between the occupied West Bank and Jordan, the WFP added. No food trucks have entered northern Gaza in October, the WFP told CNN.

On Wednesday, the WFP said in a report that the aid entering the strip has plummeted to its lowest level in months, forcing the organization to stop the distribution of food parcels in October.

“Hunger remains rampant and the threat of famine persists,” WFP added.  “If the flow of assistance does not resume, one million vulnerable people will be deprived on this lifeline.” - [**Source**](https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2024/10/11/middleeast/food-northern-gaza-starvation-un-intl) 

Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005 but kept it under a land, air and sea blockade since 2007.

In January 2024, Israeli authorities blocked 56% of humanitarian aid to northern Gaza.[156] On 9 February 2024, UNRWA director Philippe Lazzarini said that Israel had blocked food for 1.1 million Palestinians in Gaza. - [**Source**](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade_of_the_Gaza_Strip)

The European Union has said it is deeply concerned about draft Israeli legislation that would ban the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees from operating in Israel and likely scale back aid distribution across war-ravaged Gaza.

Earlier this week, an Israeli parliamentary committee approved a bill that would ban UNRWA from operating in Israeli territory and end all contact between the government and the UN agency. The bill needs final approval from the Knesset, Israel’s parliament.

“The European Union expresses its grave concern about the draft bill on UNRWA currently discussed in the Israeli parliament,” it said in a statement released on Saturday. - [**Source**](https://www.aljazeera.com/amp/news/2024/10/12/eu-gravely-concerned-over-bill-seeking-to-ban-unrwa-in-israel)

Nearly 230 workers for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency have died in Gaza following Israel’s counterattack, according to the agency.

They propped him up as an anti establishment figure while they accelerate their plans to destabilize America. While all the conservatives wait for Trump to save the day this is just a scheme to keep the people at bay. The 2 party system is a scam. Look at all the damage they’ve caused with immigration, hyperinflation, cultural problems like woke propaganda, endless race baiting, castrating children, high crime rates, proxy wars. Yet when Trump was in, who went to jail? What kind of plan has he outlined to “end the deepstate”? If he was really going after this he would be going after things like the federal reserve, the Zionist, freemasonry.

So he’s been twice impeached, several indictments, and 3 assassination attempts. Even though they own the courts, somehow he gets away everytime. Let me tell you something, if the CIA or the deepstate wanted you dead, you’d be deader than dead. They would never botch it.

You know what this is? This is a massive psyop to keep the people from revolting. Trump is the fake resistance to the tyranny while they fuck the country into the ground. It’s genius actually. You become obviously tyrannical with things like censoring freedom speech, forced covid lockdowns and injections, attempting to abolish the constitution, attempting to take guns away, artificially inflate the currency, and you create a fake resistance to the tyranny to keep the country at bay with a ray of hope while you overdrive destabilize the west.

The best part is, this has been done in the past. They’ve destabilized countries in the past propping up fake anti establishment people. Look at this conversation with chat gpt to understand a history lesson about how psyops have been conducted in the past to destabilize countries.

Have governments that intentionally destabilized countries used anti establishment figures

Yes, governments have historically used anti-establishment figures to intentionally destabilize countries as part of their geopolitical strategies. Here are some notable examples:

1. **Iran (1953)**:
   - **Operation Ajax**: The CIA and British intelligence orchestrated a coup to overthrow Iran's democratically elected Prime Minister, Mohammad Mossadegh. They supported and funded anti-establishment groups, including nationalist and religious factions, to create unrest and justify the coup, eventually restoring the Shah to power.

2. **Chile (1970s)**:
   - The U.S. government, through the CIA, supported various anti-establishment groups and activities to destabilize the government of President Salvador Allende. This included funding strikes, propaganda campaigns, and supporting opposition political parties, leading up to the military coup that brought General Augusto Pinochet to power in 1973.

3. **Nicaragua (1980s)**:
   - **Contra War**: The U.S. supported the Contra rebels, who were anti-establishment forces opposing the Sandinista government. The U.S. provided funding, training, and arms to the Contras in an effort to destabilize and eventually overthrow the Sandinista regime.

4. **Libya (2011)**:
   - During the Arab Spring, various Western governments supported anti-establishment groups and militias opposing Muammar Gaddafi. NATO's intervention, including airstrikes and support for rebel groups, contributed to the destabilization and eventual overthrow of Gaddafi's regime.

5. **Syria (2011-Present)**:
   - Multiple foreign governments have supported various anti-establishment groups, including rebels and militias, in the Syrian Civil War. This support has come in the form of funding, arms, and training to groups opposing the Assad regime, contributing to the ongoing instability and conflict in the region.

6. **Ukraine (2014)**:
   - During the Euromaidan protests and subsequent events, Western governments provided support to opposition groups and anti-establishment figures advocating for closer ties with the European Union and opposing the pro-Russian government of President Viktor Yanukovych. This contributed to political upheaval and the eventual change in government.

7. Operation Trust (Soviet Union, 1921-1926)**:
   - The Soviet secret police (Cheka) created a fake anti-Bolshevik organization called the ""Trust"" to identify and neutralize genuine anti-Bolshevik elements. By posing as an anti-establishment group, the Cheka managed to lure in and arrest actual dissidents.

These examples illustrate how governments have used anti-establishment figures and groups as tools to destabilize targeted countries, often to achieve broader geopolitical objectives. The involvement of external powers in supporting such figures can lead to significant political and social upheaval, with long-lasting consequences for the affected countries.

Now for question #2

How does an authoritarian regime benefit from propping up an anti establishment figure?

An authoritarian regime can benefit from propping up an anti-establishment figure in several strategic ways:

1. **Controlled Dissent**: By promoting an anti-establishment figure under its control, the regime can channel and manage dissent in a way that is less threatening. This figure can act as a safety valve, allowing citizens to express dissatisfaction without challenging the regime's fundamental stability.

2. **Discrediting Opposition**: An anti-establishment figure who is secretly aligned with or manipulated by the regime can be used to discredit genuine opposition. If the figure behaves erratically, promotes extreme views, or engages in scandals, it can taint the broader opposition movement, making it appear less legitimate.

3. **Intelligence Gathering**: Propping up such a figure can provide the regime with valuable information on opposition activities. By infiltrating opposition circles, the regime can gain insights into plans, networks, and strategies, which can be used to preempt or neutralize real threats.

4. **Creating Divisions**: An anti-establishment figure can be used to create splits within opposition groups. By fostering factionalism, the regime can weaken the overall opposition, making it more difficult for them to unite and challenge the regime effectively.

5. **Propaganda Tool**: The regime can use the existence of an anti-establishment figure to demonstrate that there is political pluralism and freedom of expression, even if controlled. This can be used to counter international criticism and portray a facade of legitimacy.

6. **Justifying Repressive Measures**: The regime can use the actions or rhetoric of the anti-establishment figure to justify repressive measures. By portraying the figure as a serious threat to national security or public order, the regime can legitimize crackdowns on dissent and increase surveillance.

7. **Influencing Public Opinion**: The regime can steer public discourse by using the anti-establishment figure to introduce specific narratives or ideas. This can shape public opinion in ways that ultimately benefit the regime, even if indirectly.

8. **Managing Political Transitions**: In times of political instability or potential transition, an anti-establishment figure can be used to co-opt and control the direction of change, ensuring that any transition does not threaten the core power structure of the regime.

Overall, the strategy of propping up an anti-establishment figure allows an authoritarian regime to manipulate and control opposition, maintain its grip on power, and create a controlled environment where dissent is managed and less likely to pose a real threat.

Tell me what do you guys think? I think all this media going after him, indictments, assassination attempts have been one massive psyop.

I just don’t see any other reason for the world existing like it actually doesn’t make any sense why we are here .


All we know is what we have been told and lately I think people are learning that anything mainstream cannot be trusted . So why is it that people believe so readily about space about the past etc ?? Everything is just one big lie and the truth is I don’t think we will ever know what is actually going on here . Does space actually exist ? Or is the earth like one huge Truman show esque  world ?? 

Also how the hell do humans who most of them can’t even manage to properly wipe their own bums create all this complex technology ??

Maybe I sound insane but out of all threads this is the one it makes most sense to post on. I actually feel depressed lately and that life is so pointless cause I just have a feeling none of this is real and the more I think about it the more obvious it is . 

Also the fact that we are on earth but the majority of us live these repetitive and mundane lives , work pay the bills have kids travel here and there , get your heart broken a few times … like that’s it ??

Inflation was easily 2x what they officially admit. For me rent+groceries went up from 1200 in 2019 to 2300 now. House prices have doubled within the last 5 years.

People are unable to afford a house/family. Except for the top 20% everyone is struggling financially far more than 5 years ago.

If 5 years ago you could afford 100 things and have 500 Dollars left at the end of the month and now you can afford just 90 things and have nothing left - then you are objectively doing worse.

1706496177,fake unmask dough tracker domino,"Unmasking the Dough: Is Domino’s Tracker Fake? Hey fellow conspiracy theorists,

I’ve been digging deep into something that’s been bugging me for a while, and it’s about the Domino’s Pizza Tracker.

What if the tracker’s stages of “Prep”, “Bake”, and “Quality Check” are just automated timers, not actually synced with your pizza’s real-time progress? 

Some customers have reported discrepancies in delivery times versus what the tracker shows. 

Could it be just a cleverly designed program to keep us pacified while our pizzas take their own sweet time?

There’s a Reddit post of someone calculating how much that technology would cost and it was impossibly expensive.

The Executive Cover-Up

Here’s where it gets interesting. 

Domino’s executives staunchly defend their tracker, claiming it’s based on real-time information. 

This is a publicly traded company after all. 

But what if this defense is a strategic move to maintain customer trust and the company’s market edge? After all, admitting to a ‘fake’ tracker could be a PR nightmare.

In the age of information, transparency is king. If Domino’s is pulling the wool over our eyes with a faux tracker, it raises questions about corporate honesty and customer respect.

So, what do you guys think? Are we seeing a masterclass in corporate sleight of hand here? Or is this just a case of technology not being as infallible as we thought?"

On each of these posts, they explain what the AI generated image shows, and then ask for a like or appreciation.

Now that I've explained the foundation, these posts receive hundreds and up to 10ks reacts, majority of which are the 'like,' 'heart,' and 'care reacts. In the comment section, you'll see tons of old people praising and complimenting, to even thanking these AI images for their service. It's absolutely wild. I want to add that these images are very obviously AI generated, anyone with half a brain can tell that they're fake.

But they're getting better. Genuinely better. Not to the point I'm falling for it, but if these old people fell for it before, who knows the new bracket it's gonna claim. 

(I have a lot of images to show that I will put at the bottom of this.)


My theory is this; 
     I don't know who, whether it's our own, or foreign, is doing this but I think there's a reason. To figure out at which point AI becomes unrecognizable to the general public. Not just boomers, but to us millennials/gen z/gen alpha. It's going to be used to manipulate masses more than ever before. 

When I look at the comments, these people are all the same age group with suspicious profiles. It's strange, but they have like 40 photos of family for years and years back. Maybe hacked accounts and used to bot? They ever respond to people telling them it's AI.

Then you have those people. The people commenting some random picture made in paint that says ""THIS IMAGE IS AI GENERATED, IT IS NOT REAL!"" They also have suspicious profiles, similar to the ones they're trying to divert from interacting with the post? It's all so very strange. 

The issue I have is figuring out whether those people are real, or some are real, and the others are bots boosting the algorithm and getting more views to reach more people? The worst part is, what I have here is just from TODAY. Not including the ones I’ve seen prior. Will add more as I see them!

1731739884,wa possibl humili think saw ritual live mike vs rig tyson jake paul fight,"I saw the Mike Tyson Vs Jake Paul fight, live. I think it was rigged and possibly a humiliation ritual.   I don't know how many people will believe me when I say this, but the fight was rigged.

I wouldn't even be surprised if it was a humiliation ritual

Look at Mike's face when he gets interviewed by his son he almost looked sad, as if he knew he was going to have to take a powder. Not to mention he was almost naked, other than the weights around his waist. (Part of the humiliation, having to show his naked butt to 120 million people one of them being his son. It'll end up becoming a meme for the next couple months)

The whole fight he looked like he was on dope.

Whereas when he slapped Jake Paul earlier, he flew into a rage and they had to hold him back with three or four guys.

Look at the training footage, he had way more energy then, compared to in the fight. Where his energy levels were zero.

Even the way he walked into the ring in like a black rag looking thing, instead of his jacket that he was wearing when he walked into the building. (Edit, Apparently he usually wears a towel around his neck, my mistake. Though I still don't understand why he didn't just wear the robe he had.)

Oh, and the injury, his knee was injured. How? Where did that come from? (He didn't blame him losing on the knee, which was something) did they give him that, so he walk out with what little dignity he had left?

I believe Jake Paul even admitted once that he ""was"" apart of the illuminati, when taking a lie detector test.

There was video of Jake Paul showing some people his house and on his wall was a large portrait with , several small drawings, one of them being a illuminati eye.

Shaquille O' Neil, a big Freemason, was also present.

At the end of it all he was almost in tears

Just sad, the whole deal, but I guess that's what happens when you sign on the bottom line.

I'm just glad they didn't make it so he had to take a fake knockout."

I would love to hear from anyone who has studied them more. 

Here's some footage for each landing and few screenshots of the things I've found interesting to get this thread rolling.  I couldn't find a lot of the full length originals so if anyone knows where they are for 14, 16 and 17 that would be cool.

1712085870,learn apollo see think great come worship live know god spirit judgement eden horu eye myth hyperborea thi angel paradis that' nwo prepar creator world,"I think the world is about to learn that Hyperborea is not myth. This is Eden, Paradise, where the angels live and worship the Creator and the Great Spirit. That is where Apollo is, the Eye of Horus, the All seeing Eye....that's God. The NWO knows what is coming, and they are preparing for judgement It's taught by the ancient sages and was on all of the world maps until the 1800's. It wasn't like this mythical place to the Greeks, it is 24/7 springtime in Hyperborea because of the light of Apollo as they called it, the big electromagnetic fiery cloud of light at the top of the big magnetic black mountain. They have two harvests of grain per year and made offerings to Athens annually. Hercules brought the Olympics from Hyperborea. The point is that is wasn't a myth, it was real to them. Mercator made maps of the north pole, check them out. Those four rivers are the ones from Genesis. Genesis up to the flood of Noah actually took place there.

God is real, he is just hiding away there with his angels and holy people doing the thousand year reign thing, after Tartaria/Zion got destroyed for becoming corrupt. Revelations mostly already happened, it's the Tartaria stuff, we are at the very end of Revelations, right here:

""When the thousand years are over, Satan will be released from his prison and will go out to deceive the nations in the four corners of the earth—Gog and Magog—and to gather them for battle. In number they are like the sand on the seashore. They marched across the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of God’s people, the city he loves. But fire came down from heaven and devoured them. And the devil, who deceived them, was thrown into the lake of burning sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet had been thrown. They will be tormented day and night for ever and ever.""

The camp of Gods people is Hyperborea/Eden.

Delphi is a city in Hyperborea, the Greek city is named after it, as well as Philadelphia in America. The message to the churches like Philadelphia in revelations happened 1000 years ago and the good got rescued away to Hyperborea/Eden to spend the last 1000 years in utopia while the rest of the world world does this to itself without God breathing down everyone's necks. People think God is not real and become animals it seems. That 1000 years is just about up, and it's judgement time, I'm sure the NWO are aware and prepping right now. They are likely going to try and attack Hyperborea. 

Oh yeah, when judgement happens and Hyperborea is wrecking the NWO they are going to be like ""omg alien invasion!""......don't fall for it, they are the good guys. God can destroy the NWO with a word, they have no idea how powerful God truly is, it's not even going to be a contest. This is how easy it is for god to destroy the NWO: ""And fire rains down burning up all of the attackers of Hyperborea"".....Send. It is that simple for God.

1715080703,peopl profession scientist greed subject capitalist forget corrupt much ani,"What most people forget is that Scientists are as much subject to corruption and capitalist greed as any other professionals Needless to say, human race had always held scientists in high regard and esteem and with a good reason. It's only thanks to all the inventions and discoveries they've done that we enjoy the goodies we have today.

But those my friends, were the scientists of yesterday, not today! Today's scientists no longer do inventions, they rather employ capitalist means like patents, lobbying and cartel formation to ensure the growth of their material interests. This has led to the monstrosity that we collectively call ""Big Pharma"" today.

Today's scientists run agendas and propaganda against every single person or process which can make humans self-sustaining and break their dependency on big pharma capitalism. Here are just a few examples:

**Propaganda against Intermittent Fasting:** Folks have recently discovered that practicing IF schedules such as 16x8 will cause their insulin to regulate, blood sugar level and BP to decline and a general decline in their chances of getting diseases and illnesses. Big Pharma doesn't like this nor does Big Food, both devils sustain on each other (you pump in a ton of crap from KFC or Dominos, and then merrily walk into Apollo Hospital for a health check up!). You'll often find deep state actors putting all kinds of rubbish articles against IF, none will be backed by genuine research as there is none.

**Propaganda against Ayurveda:** Ayurveda is probably the only herbal system of medicine which has survived till today since the Pagan times. One of the strongest proponents of Ayurveda is the Indian herbal company named [Patanjali](https://www.patanjaliayurved.net/). Soros backed lobbyists in the Indian system and judiciary are doing [everything they can to destroy Patanjali](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/supreme-court-comes-down-heavily-on-patanjali-for-prima-facie-violation-of-undertaking-on-claims-ads/article67891696.ece). If Patanjali dies, so will any hope of reviving Indic holistic ways of living a healthy and fulfilling life. Whether you believe in Ayurveda or not, Big Pharma does and will do everything in its power to crush Patanjali.

**Propaganda against NoFap movement:** The easiest way of controlling the average dude is to ensure his libido is constantly eroded and through that, his capacity for emotional expression is always dried out. Whether you believe in the benefits of nofap or not, the deep state knows them very well which is why they're running a full fledged propaganda against the NoFap movement. That particular sub is always watched and any posts with highly useful thoughts or ideas will always be removed under some pretext or other.

**Blatant fear mongering, misuse of public trust and profiteering during COVID times:** I had forgotten the very obvious of all! Since so many folks know and talk about this and even the companies have themselves admitted, I wondered if this can be termed a conspiracy theory at all! The side effects of Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines were well known then and now. They did everything they can to shove these half-baked vaccines down our throats and risked the lives of millions just to further Big Pharma bottomline at the risk of people's health. This is a dastardly crime against humanity which history will neither forget, nor forgive.

1722033701,cerimoni open anti-olymp,"The Anti-Olympics Opening Cerimony What started in Paris today is not really an Olympic event, I think. Bear with me.

First, the Olympic flag was raised UPSIDE DOWN (yes, really... just google it).

Also, the Olympic Fire is supposed to travel all the way from Greece to the official cauldron (originally, and still symbolically, an homage to the Greek god Apollo). But what we saw in this cauldron/baloon was that the fire simply touched it, and then obvious led lights and water vapours arose (just google again if you missed it). No fire actually lit there. The most ""sacred"" part of the ceremony was fake... all the ""sacred"" fire torch relay did NOT lit the cauldron.

Not only that, but instead of Apollo's fire, we got a (blue, smurfy style) representation of Dyonisius, the Greek version of Bacchus (yes, the god of wine and debauchery). Seems like someone else is being summoned here with this mockery fire...

And no athlete entered any stadium. They were greeted outside of them, as if they were not here to actually compete, excel.

The Olympic pledges were incomplete, summed up in comparison to previously stablished standards.

Last but not least, the imagery that was evoked just tangentially make reference to sports in general (I don't even want to talk about the unfit bodies proposedly parading in feont of us doing twitchy choreographies, like strange zombies).

I don't know what all that means, if anything... maybe it's just my impressions. Maybe it's just a fun way of thinking about the event. But an upside down flag, a fake olympic fire and lack of traditional ceremony seems... odd.

What are your thoughts on this?"

1731103952,conspiraci parti lost democrat,"The Conspiracy of the Democratic Party and How We Lost I've been a Democrat my whole life. When I was little my mom, who was active in the party, would take me to rallys and various events.  When I grew up I loved PBS, Democracy Now, Keith Oberman, etc. Never watched fox news in my life. Pretty much everyone in my life was a Democrat, with a few exceptions, and with them we just didn't discuss politics.

I've contributed to various campaigns and helped build voting blocks. In short, I loved  the party.

My values are and always have been:

* Anti-War
* Pro free speech / anti censorship
* Distrust of major intuitions and some government agencies
* Pro bodily autonomy
* Openness, tolerance, live and let live
* Meritocracy
* Anti big Pharma
* Support of ""the little guy"" and main street
* Pro-family
* Pro Science

And pretty much every democrat I know in person holds similar values, and (I thought) the party itself.

In the 2000s  I saw the Bush administration as corrupt war criminals, the worst of the worst. (And I still do). Warmongers who lied to entangle us in conflict for 2 decades.

I voted for Obama twice, but during his 2nd term I started to realize he didn't fulfill any of his campaign promises and basically continued most of the Bush policies. He even droned American citizens without a trial. 

I was a big Bernie supported and contributed his campaign, then I watched how my party attacked him and rigged the primary. Then I watched him, after a year of him telling us how evil Hillary was, endorse her and tell us how great she was. I started watching my fellow democrats, the media, and politicians become increasingly intolerant, divisive, and begin to violate the values I listed above. I started to feel uneasy.

Then Trump ran, which I thought was insane, and I bought into what was said about him at first. 

One day I was flying across country and on a layover in a midwest airport I picked up a magazine, USA Today, or Newsweek, or one of those. Trump was on the cover shaking hands with some world leader and it said ""Trump negotiates with so and so on XYZ"". I didn't think much of it. Then that evening I landed in California and was walking through the airport and saw the same magazine, but the cover was different. This time the cover showed Trump looking mean and glowering over the world leader, not shaking hands. The headline said ""Trump intimidates so and so"". That's t he first time I felt something was wrong. Here was the same publication, on the same day, same story, two different parts of the country, two very different vibes. When this happened, I decided to really pay attention and question what I was seeing. 

I saw a video of Trump saying ""Muslims, we don't want them in our country"" and I thought ""Wow, that's a pretty bigoted take, I can't support that"". And all over the media I saw my favorite talking heads decrying this and calling him a hateful racist, and rightly so. But, because of the above, I decided to seek out a full, uncut video and a transcript. What I saw shocked me. He said something like:

""There are great Muslims, doctors and scientists, and we want them here. But there are other, radical Muslims. The kind that abuse women and throw gays off of buildings. We don't want them in our country.""

I realized with horror that what he said had been cut to make it look like exactly the opposite of what he was saying. After that I started doing this same analysis with everything I saw. My heart sank, issue after issue was a hoax, a malicious edit, or something else along those lines.

* The very fine people hoax. The Russia Collusion Hoax. The Bloodbath statement.

No one around me was doing this kind of analysis and looking into it, they were just accepting whatever was said. I think what happened was, the DNC adopted Karl Rove tactics and no one noticed.  I started to question and point these things out to the people around me and what I got in return was vicious attacks, name calling, and a refusal to look at the evidence. 

Then I watched my party actively screw over very (at least in my town) popular Democrats like Tulsi, RFK, even people like Andrew Yang and others. I watched us skip the primary altogether, lie about Biden's health, and then install Kamala, who no one wanted in the 2020 primary as the candidate and then run an appalling campaign that failed drastically. I watched us turn against many prominent liberal or moderate podcasters and demonize / lie about them, pushing them to the other side. 

Covid happened, and because of my job at the time, I had a lot of behind the scenes insight.  For example, my bosses wife who was a high up lawyer at the FDA involved with the emergency use authorization said the following when I asked her about the vax: ""Sometimes its necessary to lie to the American people in order to do what's financially expedient."" I was horrified to see how almost nazi my side became during that disaster. 

Then I saw my party push an agenda that was:

* Pro War
* Pro big business
* Pro big pharma
* Anti family
* Sexist
* Racist
* Pro censorship
* Anti bodily autonomy except for abortion
* Anti meritocracy
* Very intolerant and hateful
* Constantly appeal to big institution authority

The more I looked, researched, found uncut videos, full transcripts, read bills, read scientific studies directly, not summarized by media or facebook, the more I realized how angry, corrupt, and broken it all was. The more I realized I was being lied to all the time and that whatever I was a part of, didn't share my values any more. 

That is how I came to vote republican for the first time in my life this week. Not because I think the republicans are good, or because I think Trump will fix anything, but because after trying hard for several years, I can't see any way to try to bring my party back into integrity, honor and values. We HAD to lose. That was our only chance to be forced to introspect and reform and realign towards what the majority of people actually want out of a government, rather than a collection of weird, unpopular fringe positions pushed with lies and propaganda. 

Now it might be that there is no coming back, that we fell too far and wont be able to introspect and do the work necessary to fix it, I don't know. But I had to share this story because it is the story of so many people that I have talked to in person and online. That is how we lost, not because the majority of Americans are evil dumb racists. The majority of Americans are smart, reasonable, and generally want to do the right thing. But if we just continue to demonize 1/2 of our friends and neighbors we have no chance for a positive future. 

Many of the comments I'm going to get on this post will be attacking and hateful and that's ok, that just illustrates what I am trying to say.

1724537797,trust stupid doctor,"Most doctors are stupid and should not be trusted. I know this is a long post, but i had to get it off my chest. If you don't like long posts, then don't read it and don't comment.

Most of my life i believed everything the doctor told me. I'm uneducated and left school when i was 16, while the doctor went to university, so he/she knows better.

When covid broke out i became obsessed with it and spend many hours every day researching it and after a few weeks/months i came to the conclusion that it was all a hoax and something very evil was going on.

I was able to convince my mother to not take the vax. I also told 5 other family members to not do it, but they all believed their doctor and told me i was stupid. Since then one of these 5 family members died in his sleep, another had her uterus removed (cancer or risk of cancer, i'm not sure exactly), they feel weak and do not look healthy. They had all the boosters too btw.

Everybody seems to have people around them dying. You see all these young influencers dying and if you watch alternative news sites, then you know that there is a huge excess deaths in western countries who had high vax rates.

But the doctors told us it was safe. They even tried to shame people into taking it. And the few doctors that saw something was wrong were cowards and kept their mouth shut. Only a tiny tiny percentage of doctors actually criticized the vax and all the madness that was going on.

I live a very healthy lifestyle and diet. So i did a blood test a few years ago and it turned out that i have high cholesterol even though my weight is perfect. The doctor basically told me i could die any moment and that i have to take a bunch of his pills. I refused and went online and watched a few hours of YT videos from my favorite YT doctors about this topic and came to the conclusion that reading cholesterol numbers is complicated and not as black and white as my family doctor made it sound. You need to look at the good cholesterol, bad cholesterol, Triglycerides, etc and then you can draw a conclusion. Not just look at the total cholesterol and say ""you can die any moment if you don't take these statins"".

My mother had high blood pressure and the doctor wanted to put here on 3 different medications and told her that even though there can be serious side effects from these chemical pills, she needs to take them for the rest of her life. I went online again and researched for a few hours, then bought her a few supplements, made her change her diet and told her to move her body more. Within a few weeks her blood pressure was normal and is still normal to this day. No dangerous pharmaceutical medications needed, so doctor was wrong.

My father had diabetes and died from it many years ago. Little did i know back then that some diabetes can be reversed through diet. Why did the doctor never tell him to get on a Keto diet if they are so smart?  All they did was make him eat like 15 different pills a day for the multiple health issues that he had.

My mother also had pre-diabetes when she was still eating lots of carbs, so i told her to get on a strict Keto diet and now her blood sugar is great and she lost tons of weight. But her doctor said that strict Keto is not good for her and that she should eat some carbs.

I had severe auto immune problems for over 25 years. I suspect it was caused by all the vaccines i got as a kid back in the 80's but of course i can't prove that. The doctor could not help me and his medication didn't work... and i was in pain always. Only when i started researching diets and experimenting with these diets myself, did i cure my auto immune disease. Again my doctor was useless.

I remember a quote i read from a doctor and it went something like this: ""If you want to live a healthy life, stay away from doctors and study nutrition"". This is so true. Your average family doctor is pretty stupid, they all eat garbage food like bread and pasta. I was at the hospital once and saw a doctor and a bunch of nurses taking a break outside and smoking cigarettes...They give ice cream and other sugary food to cancer patients in hospitals. Its unbelievable.

It's the same with dentists. I used to eat a lot of sugar which gave me loads of cavities. My dentist filled my mouth with mercury, according to him the mercury was completely safe, even though mercury is so toxic that the dentist is not allowed to throw it in the garbage, they have a special box to dump it in...but in your mouth it is completely safe. Why did the dentist never told me to stop eating sugar when i was a kid? Either he was making too much money of me, or he is stupid. Since i stopped eating sugar and carbs, my teeth problems went away.

Root canals are very dangerous and can even kill you. I asked my dentist about it and i even showed him a text from a book of a holistic dentist that did a study about this topic. But my arrogant dentist looked at me like i was an idiot and was even insulted that i would question him and his brilliant mind. I guess he is making too much money from root canals, he is a very rich man.

The last time i went to the dentist was about 3 years ago during the height of the covid hoax. I had a cavity and he gave me a local anesthesia, when i got home i became very sick with a high fever. This never happened to me before and i've probably had like 15 anesthesia injections before. I also took oregano oil and a little bit of colloidal silver for killing bacteria before the visit but i still became very sick. I always take these supplements before fixing a cavity but never got sick before.

This made me think...could they put the vax poison in the anesthesia and do i have that mRNA garbage in my blood? I know it sounds insane and paranoid, but after all the crimes our governments have committed, especially in the last 4 and a half yeas, nothing will surprise me any more.

I probably would have been better off if i never visited a dentist. Just brush, floss and don't eat sugar or carbs and you will probably never need a dentist. I recently bought a 10 dollar tartar remover from ali express that cleans my teeth just as well as at the dentist does.

All i can say is that i'm scared to death of needles, doctors, dentists and big Pharma.

Now i'm not saying that they are all dumb, obviously a brain surgeon is extremely smart and handy and if i need a surgery then i'm grateful to the surgeon if he fixes my problem. Or if i have an infection, then i will be happy to take an antibiotic. If i get in a car accident or break my leg falling from my bike, then yes, doctors are awesome and can save your life.

Just be careful when taking health advice from these people, especially your average family doctor. Most are not open to discussions and are very arrogant and cannot critically think or admit that they might have been wrong about something. Like with the vax, none of them admitted they were wrong or let alone apologized for killing people.

If only i knew the things i know today i would have been a lot more healthy. Unfortunately there was no internet when i was younger and we had to rely on incompetent doctors.

EDIT: There's a lot of people here trying to shame me for leaving school at 16. That is the only argument they have to ridicule me. As if me not having been to school much, makes any difference to my experiences. For decades i've spend many hours every day reading and researching topics that i find interesting, i speak 3 languages, not that that makes me special...who cares. But having been to school does not necessarily make you smart, and avoiding school does not always mean you're dumb.

Look how dumb some of these ""highly educated"" people were that vaccinated their children multiple times with a dangerous vaccine, for a virus with a 99.96% survival rate if you are under 70 years old. Having common sense is a thousand times more important than having some masters degree paper.

I'm a bit surprised how many insults and downvotes i'm getting for not trusting big pharma and the covid vaccine. It seems the majority here think that the covid vaccine and big pharma are good stuff. Don't know if these are bots or just very brainwashed people.

And using the title ""most doctors are stupid"" was wrong of me. I probably should have said ""most doctors are closed minded, stubborn, arrogant, cant think outside the box, are greedy and sometimes even evil"" ...that would be more accurate than ""stupid"". They are not stupid in that they have a low iq."

I guess this is his income but this behavior really deligitimizes his arguments and wastes time.

There was ample time to review:

The complete lunacy that makes up the Artemis mission. He did not even know the basic details of this mission or that tin can called the Starship rocket.

The lack of a space suit for the Artemis mission and how they will cost billions when the Apollo ones were developed for just over 100k and sewed by hand at the Playtex factory.

The ridiculous videos of the astronauts suspended on wires or defying gravity on their moonwalks.

The ridiculous videos of the Moon rover driving around aimlessly and producing rooster tails of dust as you would on earth.

No mention of the film American Moon or anyone else who criticizes the Moon Landings.

No mention of the Moon rock Big Bertha that was found be be of earth origin and the claim is that it was knocked loose by an asteroid billions of years ago and ended up on the moon to be found by apollo astronauts...

No mention of the impossibility of the Apollo lander construction or the ridiculous rendezvous video with the command module.


So disappointing but I knew it would be like this...I have heard Sibrel many times and he only promotes the limited  stuff on his dumb website.
If he debates anyone articulate he is going to get creamed.

In the cctv footage she is wearing Pumas and during the body cam she’s wearing vans? Seems a bit fishy to me. Thoughts? 
1725219687,wa moon hoax discuss land think,"Do you think the moon landing was all a hoax? Discuss. 1.	The Flag Waving in the Wind:
	•	Conspiracy theorists often point to footage of the American flag appearing to wave as evidence that the moon landing was staged in a studio. Since there is no atmosphere on the moon, they argue, the flag shouldn’t move. NASA explains that the flag moved due to the astronauts twisting the flagpole into the lunar soil, causing ripples that made it appear as though it was waving.
	2.	The Shadows and Lighting Anomalies:
	•	Skeptics claim that shadows in the moon landing photos are inconsistent, suggesting the use of multiple light sources, like those in a studio setting. However, experts explain that the uneven terrain on the moon and the sun as the single light source can create strange shadow angles. Additionally, light reflecting off the lunar surface can cause such anomalies.
	3.	No Stars in the Photos:
	•	One of the most frequently cited pieces of “evidence” is the absence of stars in the photos taken on the moon. Conspiracy theorists argue that this is because the landings were filmed on Earth, and including stars would have made it difficult to fake the sky accurately. In reality, the cameras used by the astronauts were set with fast exposure times to capture the brightly lit lunar surface, which washed out the faint light from distant stars.
	4.	The Van Allen Radiation Belts:
	•	A significant argument is that the astronauts could not have survived the radiation in the Van Allen belts that surround the Earth. Skeptics argue that passing through these belts would have been lethal. However, scientists have pointed out that the Apollo spacecraft were designed with sufficient shielding, and the astronauts passed through the belts relatively quickly, minimizing their exposure.
	5.	The Lack of Recent Moon Landings:
	•	Some conspiracy theorists argue that the lack of recent manned missions to the moon is evidence that the original landings were faked, as NASA could not replicate the “hoax.” However, the real reason is more mundane: after the initial landings, public interest and government funding for moon missions waned, leading to the focus shifting to other space exploration projects.
	6.	The Stanley Kubrick Connection:
	•	One of the more elaborate versions of the moon landing hoax theory claims that renowned filmmaker Stanley Kubrick was hired by NASA to direct the staged moon landings, using the techniques he perfected in his film 2001: A Space Odyssey. This theory suggests that Kubrick’s detailed sets and groundbreaking special effects were used to convince the world that the U.S. had won the space race. There is no credible evidence to support this claim, and it remains a piece of speculative fiction."

1713232596,govern hoax complicit,"Our government is a Hoax but how complicit are we?  The easiest way to see our government is a hoax (not a democratic republic) is to understand that the nation's money supply is controlled by the privately owned Federal Reserve which is NOT a government entity. In theory, the US treasury could issue debt-free US dollars on its own but instead it borrows the money with compound interest from the Fed which prints money out of thin air in order to buy more US treasury bonds to service the existing debt. We have a debt-based system which means the money supply and the debt are one and the same. Due to compound interest, the money supply must constantly grow i.e. the debt must exponentially increase which is why spending can't be controlled because otherwise the house of cards would collapse. The debt is now increasing by one trillion dollars every 100 days which means that trillions more must be printed out of thin air to keep the system going- even though this causes massive inflation.

The president and Congress pretend to control the Federal Reserve but the politicians are merely front-men who are there to distract us from the real power, which is the hidden trillionaire owners of the global Central Banks, who also own the MSM, the alt-media, the entertainment industry and the rest of the global Deep State. Voting is an exercise in futility because all of the candidates are controlled and we have a UNIPARTY. Divide and conquer works every single time which is why ""we the people"" will never unite.

Many say the government lost its sovereignty with the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913 but it was always this way and the hidden PTB simply exerted greater overt control in 1913. The US is and always has been part of the so-called Crown corporation.

The US dollar is a fiat currency based on nothing but it's been the global reserve currency since the early 1970s, which has enabled us to grow fat and dumb while the PTB distracted us with bread and circuses. We've had the ""Brave New World"" experience in which the masses enjoy their servitude vs. the ""1984"" model of tyranny (China) with a boot stomping in your face."

I hate that they say it was debunked.

We were gaslit and moved on and now if you even bring it up people act like you are stupid or some kind of extremest. There was an investigator around 2016 who said he found encrypted zip files on the comet pizza website containing sexual abuse images. He contacted the police with directions as to how to access the files because it was illegal to download them and was speaking to a detective who was at first interested in what he had to say. When the shooter came into the pizza palar, shortly after the investigator contacted the police, he shot the computer hard drives, I kid you not. The investigator kept checking in and was told the investigation was already completed, which he found unbelievable because he claims he saw CSAM material on the website with his own eyes. When he sent in a FOYA request it showed that the investigation never even happened and the website was quickly changed. He believed that the videos and files were still on the server somewhere but the police and the FBI did not continue the investigation despite there allegedly being proof of abuse on the website. I wish I could find out more information about the investigator and his research but it looks like alot of things from back then are gone so I cant even say if its true or not."

Do they all of a sudden not care about the Moon anymore? Detractors say there is nothing to see on the Moon and they already saw everything in the 1960s. How can they say that when it was all so poorly filmed back then with low quality cameras.

People want to see beautiful 60 FPS 4K HD videos of the Moon's craters and surface with astronauts jumping around in real time nowadays.

1724166638,free real energi,"Free Energy is Real My name is Ashton Forbes and I'm the guy who has been researching gravity/spacetime manipulation. Along the way I came to a major discovery. Free Energy is real.

I'll explain how it's possible, the laws of thermodynamics, and how it has been suppressed from us.

Space is not empty. Richard Feynman said there's enough energy in the area of a coffee cup to vaporize all the Earth's oceans. There are zero-point fluctuations (ZPF) all around us. This is not just theory, it is experimentally proven. The Casimir Effect shows a negative energy pressure differential by placing two conductive plates very close to one another.

Sakharov 1968 first proposed that zero-point energy (ZPE) could explain gravity itself. Since E = mc^2 mass is energy. So energy and mass can explain gravity. Puthoff in 1989 showed mathematically this conclusion is consistent with Einstein's General Relativity. Gravity is an induced effect based on ZPF.

Instead of the vacuum of Space being empty, it's at a baseline ZPF level. This means it can be lowered by shielding the ZPF in an area (remember, Casimir Effect). So we can produce negative energy. It's not an exotic substance, it's just a reduction from baseline. Remove the ZPF in front of you and you would 'fall forward.' This is gravity manipulation.

The energy must go somewhere. If you squeeze the vacuum, like a balloon, the other side inflates. This is the basis for free energy, extracting that ZPE and turning it into usable energy. There's something called the Dynamic Casimir effect which shows we can capture virtual photons and convert them to real photons, essentially pulling them from the vacuum.

There's also something called Casimir Cavities. A professor named Garret Moddel has been experimenting and the scientific community has ignored him. He has a method that can be scaled down to a microchip that can seemingly extract energy from the vacuum.

Where does energy come from? I would argue all energy comes from the ZPE field. I refer to it as the Aether because that's what the scientists who came before us called it. If you don't believe this check out the Veritasium video on youtube about power not flowing through wires. A bunch of youtubers tried to debunk it and ended up looking like fools. Turns out Electrical Engineers don't even understand the basics of energy.

Tom Bearden once said that all the coal, oil, nuclear, solar, and wind never added one Watt to the power lines, and he's correct. Energy flows when we create a dipole, an asymmetry of charges. Like a battery. All the power generation we have pretty much just turns a generator.

We've been generating energy the hard way. Like pushing a swing non-stop instead of at the peak of the backswing. We should just be focused on ways to keep the dipole open instead of constantly rebuilding it. Magnets immediately come to mind because they're permanent dipoles. This is probably why magnets are a staple in free energy devices you see.

Many people have been brainwashed into thinking the laws of thermodynamics mean Free Energy is not possible, but that's simply a lack of understanding of those laws.

The first law of thermodynamics states energy cannot be created or destroyed. In this case we're simply borrowing it from the Aether. The energy has always been there. Dark energy is negative energy, which is the equilibrium energy in Spacetime. So there's no violation of conservation of energy.

The second law of thermodynamics is more complicated but generally applies to closed systems. If we open our system to the Universe itself then we also don't violate the second law. A windmill as a closed system can't produce energy, but once you add the external input of wind, it can. This is similar to opening your overunity system to the ZPF, only the ZPF are practically unlimited. Therefore, there's no violation of the second law either.

Not all free energy devices are legit. Especially when it comes to magnet based motors you need to be careful because there's not just front end applications, but also back end ones that need to be met, aka the design of the circuit. This is why you'll sometimes see recreation attempts that claim they don't work. That's because if you don't understand the science you'll almost certainly fail.

Cold fusion, also known as Low Energy Nuclear Reactions is a form of Free Energy. That's why fusion generators are claiming overunity. We don't need temperatures as high as the sun to produce fusion.

Based on the above scientific concepts, Free Energy devices should exhibit common phenomena. Coefficient of Performance (CoP) > 1, though this doesn't mean there has to be zero input. Input is fine as long as the total output is higher. A cooling reduction, because when you extract energy from the environment, the environment cools down. There is also a mass reduction effect since the ZPE is related to gravity. Generally this is very small but measurable for these devices. If you want to learn more I suggest Bedini, Searl, Hutchinson, and Bearden.

How has it been suppressed? Mostly because humans are idiots. As I said we've been brainwashed into thinking it's not possible and that belief is extremely powerful. I found a guy who testified against Free Energy inventors and he never once reviewed the devices. He would just give expert opinion in court that their claims were not possible because he knew the laws of thermodynamics. 

If you doubt any of this look at how many people were convinced wearing a loose piece of cloth on their face will protect them from a submicroscopic virus. We're dumb and we love authority.

They would also compromise inventors, buy them out and shelve their products, or just hide the patents with the invention secrecy act. There's more patents than I thought out there for what I believe to be real devices.

The last hurdle is economics. Free Energy doesn't mean it costs nothing. The devices themselves are expensive and that's a main reason it hasn't got mainstream. You don't automatically become a billionaire because you invented a device that can extract energy from the vacuum. It needs to be economical compared to alternatives. Many of these devices would cost hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars.

Ultimately the costs of these devices will go down and we will have Overunity. It will replace all current sources of power and give us true green energy. Climate change is a scam because we have the ability to end the problem today.

Last point. People will say, ""well go on CNN and prove it then."" Nah, I'm good. I like living on this planet. The 'bad guys' are already pissed enough at me for what I've been revealing. Also, that's not how any of this works. I actually did challenge a couple of those engineers mentioned above from the Veritasium video. They refused to take the challenge. All they had to do was sign an NDA not to disclosure IP about the device and if it works make a statement on their youtube channels. None would do it. Think about that.

So how do we prove the science? I think the first hurdle will be EM Drive. Yes, the 'impossible drive.' Charles Buhler was the electrostatics expert at NASA and he's done over 3000 tests that show anomalous thrust with propellantless propulsion. The EM Drive, Q Drive, or any of the other variants of this will prove all of the concepts related to free energy and gravity manipulation to be true. That's why they've had to suppress the tests of these drives. Check earlier in February, the quantum drive connected to the Barry-1 supposedly stopped communicating and so the test never completed. They announced this months after the fact and never issued a follow up.

So they flew 6 times to The Moon and then they stopped all of a sudden? They lost all interest? Now they say they lost the telemetry tapes as well? Or did they record over all the tapes? They also say that in 2024 they do not know how to build the lunar lander again? Can't they build a super improved version of it now with 2024 technological know how? like a star wars or star trek version? **Science did not stop in 1960**.

If they built an aluminum foil wrapped lunar lander in 1960 and took it to the Moon, then surely in 2024 they should be able to build a beautiful futuristic spaceship-esque lunar lander since technology has advanced so much since then. An iPhone 15 in 2024 is thousands of times more powerful than every computer on earth in 1960 for example.

Whenever they come into my topics they say they do not know how to weld and rebuild that specific exact lunar lander like in the 1960s. That is such stupid logic. Why would they need to build that 1960s version if in 2024 they have supercomputer technology to build a super futuristic new version of the lunar lander. It's like saying they do not know how to build a 1912 Ford Model-T anymore in 2024 because they don't have the original Ford data, when that is a stupid comparison because they can build a Bugatti Tourbillion instead in 2024, which is a much more advanced vehicle.

Why doesn't NASA take all the advanced 2024 technological know-how and build a brand new more powerful lunar lander today? **Did science get stuck in 1960 for NASA** and they are still stuck in the 1960s with 1960s technology? They never made it past the 1960s and are forever stuck there with old technology?"

It's really important that everyone understands this truth as this exposes how corrupt ALL governments are. Most people here would agree that republicans and democrats are two sides of the same coin but can't apply that same logic on a larger scale, that is, to all governments. I mentioned all that because the real reason why most people believe that they live on a giant water ball is because all the governments\\scientists are in agreement that we live on a giant water ball. The Milgram Experiment shows that when coerced by authority figures humans can be made to do terrible things. It logically follows that if they can be made to do terrible things, they can be made to believe terrible things. If you want good quality information regarding flat earth consult witsitgetsit:

[Witsit Gets It - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@WitsitGetsIt)

Without further ado, here is my number one proof of flat earth:

1. The electrical engineer and inventor Marconi broke the record for the longest radio signal transmission ever. The problem with this is seeing that radio signals are a form of light, they must travel in a straight line and can’t go through matter as thick as the earth’s crust. Marconi transmitted a radio signal so far that it puzzled physicists because it suggested that the radio signal traveled through the earth’s crust, which is impossible. This alone is enough proof that the world is not a sphere. However, some of the smartest dummies gathered around, and came up with a rather unimaginative and predictable answer. The atmosphere came again to the rescue. According to these wise guys, the radio signals must have bounced off of the atmosphere back down to earth. You see, it's not that there's no evidence for flat earth, but that such evidence always gets brushed to the side to support what we ""know"" to be true.
2. Another curious thing about all of this is the Radio act of 1912. The Radio Act of 1912, formally known as ""An Act to Regulate Radio Communication"", is a United States federal law which was the first legislation to require licenses for radio stations. A key provision was the restriction of most amateur stations to wavelengths below 200 meters (frequencies above 1500 kHz), an assignment that greatly limited their transmitting range until the discovery a decade later of the great distances achievable through shortwave transmissions. The consensus at the time said that frequencies above that range were useless. One can only wonder if the radio act was meant to suppress the discovery of long distance radio transmissions.& I wonder if they’re currently holding back certain technologies that would be beneficial for mankind.

If you don't understand what mind control is, see these links [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/15vqlrk/comment/jwysg8c/), [here](http://www.whale.to/b/dowbenko1.html), [here](https://hollywoodsubliminals.wordpress.com/project-monarch/), [here](http://www.whale.to/b/patton.html), [here](https://mormonmonarch.com/what-is-mk-ultra/) for some basic information. This post is quote-heavy for the character limit.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is involved in high-level government trauma-based mind control slave programming, torture, human/child trafficking, illegal human experimentation, advanced 'antigravity' craft design, implementation of 'New World Order' plans, and more.

NASA plays a large part of the cult/government mind control network, with an emphasis on advanced high-tech programming of the dissociative slaves. A large number of government mind control/cult ritual abuse survivors recall being taken to and tortured/programmed in various NASA facilities and laboratories. While of course NASA has legitimate programs, much of their funding and technology is used for slave programming and highly illegal human experimentation. They are also used as a cover to hide programs in (for example, CIA projects hidden in NASA's files). This post will focus specifically on the mind control programming aspect of NASA, though they are involved in much more under their public cover. NASA has a core group of Nazi/cult scientists and mind control programmers, just as the CIA does.

""*...There were several facilities that he took me to that were NASA facilities. The NASA connections seem to be directly connected to the Paperclip connection. The Nazis were brought into the country and then were integrated into the NASA structure after the war.*""

- Kathleen Sullivan [14]

""*NASA was, at least in the past, part of the overall network because NASA was initially formed by members of the same groups of Nazi war criminals who were brought to the U.S. by our government from the 1940s, on. This includes, of course, Werner Von Braun. [Linda Hunt’s 'Secret Agenda'](https://www.scribd.com/doc/59685958/Linda-Hunt-Secret-Agenda) can give you more information about this...the CIA and other intelligence agencies have worked hand-in-hand with NASA, and some of its employees and departments, to further mind-control experimentation. Although some of NASA’s programs are certainly legitimate...I believe that NASA is involved in much more than that, and that NASA has been used to hide certain activities within its own organizational borders.*""

- Kathleen Sullivan [17]

""*According to Linda Hunt’s ""Secret Agenda: The United States Government, Nazi Scientists, and Project Paperclip"", NASA was basically created by a group of Nazi immigrants who had been brought into the US by the Army and CIA, their records whitewashed in the process. Some were proven war criminals. Although I am certain that most of NASA’s current activities are legitimate, it is quite possible that some of its Nazi founders and their associates could have worked all along as double agents, using its facilities and equipment as I believe was also done within the CIA - to further the Reich’s heady goal of eventual world domination (A.K.A. the New World Order).*""

- Kathleen Sullivan [18]

""*Survivor of the MK-Monarch program, Cathy O'Brien, writes: 'There are many similar facilities in our country, within various CIA, Army, and NASA complexes, where the government's hyper-advanced knowledge is developed, tested and modified. The people I met, who had studied in depth the scientific mechanisms of the brain and the ins and outs of the mind, used this accumulation of secret knowledge to manipulate and/or control others...'*""

- Alexandre Lebreton [13]

- Fritz Springmeier [16]

""*Another underground, concrete-walled room housed expensive electronic  equipment that accessed what was identified to me as the 'Brandon' computer system. J.C. and his father-in-law told me that the computer system held pertinent information on every government-programmed slave in the US - including the names and training of all their documented alter-states and how each one could be triggered out. They taught several of my  alter-states how to use the system; based on what I saw, what they told me seemed to be correct. They said the reason the information would never be found in the CIA’s files, was because it was stored on at least one of NASA’s computer systems.*""

- Kathleen Sullivan [18]

Regarding their involvement in mind control atrocities:

""*The interesting thing is how many people have described the same scenario, and how many people that we have worked with who have had relatives in NASA, in the CIA, and in the Military, including very high-ups in the Military.*""

- D. Corydon Hammond - [7]

""*I was raised in the affluent area of Woodland Hills, California, but was abused my entire life in many locations in and out of California, including hospitals, universities, and United States military and NASA bases, where I was subjected to 'high-level' programming. The result of many years of trauma, intentionally inflicted on me by my father and others to create within me multiple personalities, was that I was transformed into a programmed, totally robotical slave that could not remember to think or tell what happened to me, due to the mind control and sophisticated programming I was under.*""

""*Goddard NASA facility near Washington, DC - I was taken there in approximately 1968, to be mentally programmed. Huntsville NASA facility in Alabama - mental programing was done to me at that facility after my family moved to Georgia in 1969*""

- Kathleen Sullivan [18]

""*Whether I was in a military, NASA, or government building, the procedure for maintaining me under total mind control remained consistent with Project Monarch requirements. This included prior physical and/or psychological trauma; sleep, food, and water deprivation; high voltage electric shock; and hypnotic and/or harmonic programming of specific memory compartments/personalities. The high tech equipment and methodisms I endured from that time on gave the U.S. government absolute control of my mind and life. I had been literally driven out of my conscious mind and existed only through my programmed subconscious. I lost my free will, ability to reason, and could not think to question anything that was happening to me. I could only do as I was told.*""

- Cathy O'Brien [1]

""*As I grew older, by the time I was five, I was being taken to military bases in and out of California and officials there were programming me, and later, doctors at UCLA Neuropsychiatric Institute in California, and places where there were NASA installations - I was also programmed.*""

Science experimentation has also been reported by survivors.

""*They’re using children, not just for sexual purposes, they’re using them for science experimentation. I was sold to NASA and used in NASA programs, put in simulators where I was forced to stay in a simulator for weeks at a time. They were experimenting on the different gravitational forces and things like that, and how it would affect a child. They were doing different experiments on me in these capsules, there was zero gravity so you’re floating around the air. They would probe you in your orifices with these pure crystal rods to obtain cells with, and then they were flying them in space capsules into space and growing them in labs and experimenting with all these different cells. I know my cells have been in space. I'm assuming that there’s other children that they’ve used in these experiments. I was with, in particular on the NASA trips, I was with my handler.*""

""*I overheard Rose talk about the fact that some of the Kennedy money was tied directly into NASA 'subprojects' they funded and somehow there was a huge profit from it.

Henry said that, in the future, man would explore 'inner space.'*""

- Brice Taylor [10]

""*I was born into a Satanic cult family who practiced occultism and Satanism. My grandfather had ties to NASA, they were doing all kinds of science experimentation through through NASA programs and I believe that my mom was a breeder, so they bred her and they were taking eggs and embryo and putting them in various women. I know Jeffrey Epstein back then was doing this project, wanting to feed the human race with his DNA and all this crazy stuff, and they had these connections so they were they were breeding my mom and I was born for trafficking purposes...so I was born to be sold as a small child at three. I was trafficked to Jeffrey. I was born actually to a man named Gary Kimball of Broward county in Florida, which was about an hour and a half from where we lived and I've known Gary my whole life. I grew up around Gary and being flown out of his airport, he owns a private airport in Broward county that I would be flown out of...Jeffrey used to fly in and out of there and back then they they controlled all the air traffic control and stuff in and out of there, so they could get in and out of there pretty inconspicuously. I have seen Jeffrey get very severely ritually abused, I have seen him strapped to chairs with these straps across his face like a gas mask and being tortured, literally screaming and yelling, and I'm just this little girl and they’re forcing me to watch this type of stuff. It was Jeffrey, he became a handler, they manufactured him as well and he became a handler. He was basically a fall guy and a front guy for them, I mean he was controlled too, and I don’t think a lot of people realize that.*""

US Government slaves are routinely taken to NASA facilities to be programmed using their [advanced mind control technology](https://svalispeaksagain.wordpress.com/tech-torture/).

""*Military mind-control was fast, effective, and highly technological, but it was the NASA programming that launched me as a 'Presidential Model'.  Even though [Michael Aquino](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1049hkj/comment/j342r7m/) instilled my programming on both military and NASA installations, he had access to the latest technological advancements and techniques through NASA. These included mind foolers [such as sensory deprivation tanks](https://mormonmonarch.com/the-other-side/), virtual reality, flight simulators, and harmonics. By the age of two, Kelly had already been subjected to Aquino and his programming through these latest technological advancements, which shattered her fragile young mind before her base personality had a chance to form. Rather than use occultism on Kelly, Aquino traumatized her through sexual assault and high voltage tortures of the mind and body. She, like I, to this day carries numerous scars from this 'non satanic' abuse base. I know, from years of research, NASA technology and Aquino's programming, combined with the Project Monarch standard sleep, food, and water deprivation and high voltage, made Kelly a subject of state of the art genetically multigenerational MPD/DID psychological mind-control engineering.*""

- Cathy O'Brien [1]

""*Another time doctors in white coats played perceptual mind games with me at a NASA installation. First they took me 'through the course', they called it, and I was taken from chairs that performed different operations, like one that spun, then next to an isolation chamber. They put huge eye machines up to my face and had me close one eye and then the other in order to program each side of the brain separately. Some things were then reversed and programmed into another area of my brain through the opposite eye. They called this 'cross-programming.' For other functions, both sides of my brain had to be operating syncronistically. Information for mind file use was stored only on one side of my brain.*""

- Brice Taylor [10]

""*In 1981, [(US Senator Robert) Byrd](https://mormonmonarch.com/meeting-with-a-byrd-in-the-garden/) personally joined Aquino in Huntsville, Alabama during one of our programming sessions. NASA cooperated fully with Byrd on any and everything, since it was Byrd's Senate Appropriations Committee that determined how much and/or whether NASA received government funding. Byrd was providing Aquino with specific details of certain perversions he wanted me equipped to fulfill or perform. Additionally, they talked about scrambling my immediate memory with two private porn films they were arranging to have produced locally. These were titled How To Divide a Personality and How To Create a Sex Slave. These films are the kind NASA became involved in producing for the dual purpose of 'scrambling' memory and documenting their mind-control procedures. The resident Huntsville, Alabama pornographers were two local cops, one of which was (and is) a Sergeant. This served NASA and the CIA well when cover-up was necessary. The How To Create a Sex Slave film depicts the common ['spin' programming](http://www.whale.to/c/spin_programming9.html), which in essence is the combination to unlocking or accessing a specific programmed act.*""

- Cathy O'Brien [1]

""*Wayne Morris: You mentioned the more sophisticated technology, particularly at NASA, and some of the military bases. Can you describe that, and what effect they were trying to have on you?*""

""*Brice Taylor: A lot of that was being sat in a chair that looked like the NASA space chairs, where I would be strapped in. A lot of the equipment that I imagine was used by the astronauts was used on me. A lot of the spinning, the weightlessness, being put into sensory deprivation tanks. Being subjected to a lot of the light and sound along with electroshock.*""

- Brice Taylor [4]

""*I have been healed layer after layer, but there are still other layers to this programming. The most recent area has had to do with NASA. In the programming, I was put on a gravity machine for training astronauts. This machine spins on an axis. They take your hands and feet and stretch them as far as they can and then strap you into the cage. There are electrodes that are placed on your hands, heart, sexual part, and feet. There is a halo that is placed on your head to cause electric shock. As you’re spinning, you are electrocuted in these areas to cause extreme pain. This is performed as a test to see how much pain you can endure before submitting to do what they ask you to do. I tried and tried to endure the pain, but it was too great. My programmers told me they were superhuman and that I could be like them...they said if I did what they told me to do, I would be able to save the boys, 'my brothers,' from being that way. So at that point, I did the hideous things they said to do. There was no way out, no other alternative. After I was forced to do what they said, the programmers said that God had rejected me and sent me away. To make me feel like I had been sent away, I was put into the cabin that had no gravity and left there by myself. I thought I had been sent into space and would never be found. To take this even further and make them look like my rescuers, they showed up again and said that my heart had been found to be black. So they stated that I was sent to the black hole 'hell' by God. According to them, the black hole was a place where the rejects and failed experiments went. If I did good enough there, competed, and won, then I could get another chance at real life. The constant hell of trying to be good enough and to save people continued nonstop. I was taken to NASA and programmed many times. This programming has taken the longest to surface because of the depth of the involvement of the government in this type of programming. They buried this programming very deep so that it would never be exposed. There are members of the Illuminati in every walk of life who try to infiltrate and pollute governments, businesses, and churches; and the list goes on.*""

""*NASA seems to have been crawling with this stuff for quite a while. When I read Linda Hunt's book, 'Secret Agenda', it was a big time education for me on why, because a lot of these Nazi war criminals ended up being put in NASA...they set up NASA, literally set it up. Werner Von Braun's record was cleaned up...At the NASA facilities, they had some incredibly unusual programming that they did to some of us. I had one experience at age fifteen, I was taken to Goddard, which is a NASA facility outside of D.C. One of the things they seemed to like to do is [dress up just like they are in Startrek](http://whale.to/b/sp/for1.html#The_Structuring_Done_in_Monarch_Star_Trek_and_Star_Wars_Programming_)...they actually wear Startrek uniforms with the Enterprise logo on them. This was the old Startrek. Sometimes they would hypnotize me to think they were Dr. Spock, Bones, Captain Kirk and stuff, so I could not remember what their faces really looked like. One of the things they did at Goddard was very, very professional, very ingenious. They hooked me up to some kind of a computer system, very high tech for that period of time. They had earphones - more like a helmet on my head - and I don't understand how all this worked - but I closed my eyes and I could actually see images flashing in front of my face...I have been to Huntsville, Houston, Cape Canaveral, and Titusville I think was also a NASA facility...they did some nasty torture there.*""

So there was a lot of terror to try to cause me to never speak about who was specifically there. I, of course, remember their faces, but it it was a complete fear programming layered, over top of each other over and over again. They were doing joint rituals where there was tons of other kids as well that were being tortured in the same way...I did see other children being hurt as well. So it it was around 8 years old until about 12, but it was just periodic episodes, rituals that they would do, joint rituals, where their focus is to reprogram.'*""

I didn’t question, and I just like I said, thought we were going camping in it. Jeffrey was there, there’s a lot of big people there, and I ended up being drugged in one of the campers and gang raped. I remember hearing men come in and saying 'which side', because they had me on one side and a dead girl on the other side, and I remember hearing my handlers joke about 'oh the dead ones over here, the live ones over here', so the men that entered could either go you know have sex with the corpse or they could go have sex with 'the live one' over here, and I was the live one that they were using.

**See my ['Overview of What Disney & Disneyland Actually Are: Mind Control Programming, Child Trafficking, And More](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/16zdtr4/overview_of_what_disney_disneyland_actually_are/)' post for further Disney information.**

NASA plays a large part in the relatively newer 'alien abduction' programming scenarios which many victims have endured.

I wrote a 3-part post on this exact subject, with many quotes and lots of further information from first-hand sources and survivors of this 'alien'-themed programming. Read:

- ['Alien Abduction' Programming Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/14ueiba/alien_abduction_mind_control_programming/)

- ['Alien Abduction' Programming Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/14unmph/alien_abduction_mind_control_programming_part_2/)

- ['Alien Abduction' Programming Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/14uelkk/alien_abduction_mind_control_programming_part_3/)

""*It is obvious that for various reasons (including the goals set down in the secret [Iron Mountain government report](https://projectcamelot.org/Report_from_Iron_Mountain.pdf)), the government (including cooperating agencies like NASA) decided to use an alien abduction theme rather than a Satanic Ritual Abuse theme to their mind-control programming.*""

- Fritz Springmeier [15]

""*The effect of Bush's illusion hologram on such victims is binding and strong. Even Aquino envied the mind shattering effects of Bush's alien theme visual traumas to the extent that he wrote and published his own comic book sequel to Lucas' Star Wars. While occultism is easily dispelled with reason and fact, Bush's alien theme continues to be reinforced through NASA's involvement in mind-control atrocities.*""

- Cathy O'Brien [1]

A programming theme NASA uses in conjunction with 'alien' scripts is an 'interdimensional' theme, very strong programming convincing the slave that they are actually 'travelling dimensions'. This ties into the programmers pretending they are all-powerful 'space aliens'.

""*The [Alice In Wonderland programming theme](https://mymkultra.wordpress.com/2020/05/07/internal-world-symbolism-alice-in-wonderland/) is used in air-water programs and mirror programs which the Illuminati, the CIA, NASA, [the Jesuits](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1eoit00/comment/lhhzkm6/) and others like so well. The idea is that there exists a mirror world which is a reversal. Along with it is attached the idea that the slave can enter into a timeless dimension of time, or as some refer to it 'interdimensional time travel.'*""

- Fritz Sprigmeier [15]

""*[(Pierre) Trudeau](https://trance-formation.com/trudeau-mk-ultra/) expertly manipulated my mind with sophisticated hypnotic language. Not only did he enlist my 'Silence' for the pedophile perversions he indulged in, but he instructed my 'school of thought' in a manner that equated to programming. He laid a foundation for Air-Water programs that is a mirrordimensional theme often used by NASA and others involved in Project Monarch. Playing off his own name 'Pee-Air,' he added a perverse twist to the theme that he accessed each time I was prostituted to him.*""

""*Early the next morning, [deep underground](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/135h5of/deep_underground_military_base_dumb_information/) in the NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center mind-control lab near D.C., Bill Bennett began preparing me for the program. NASA uses various 'CIA designer drugs' to chemically alter the brain and create exactly the mind set required at the time. Huntsville, Alabama's NASA drug of choice, 'Train-quility,' created a feeling of absolute, peaceful compliance and a sensation of walking on air. The drug administered this time was sufficiently similar to Tranquility to create total compliance. The beating I had endured the night before had rendered me helpless, anyway, and I could barely crawl up onto the cold, metal lab table as the drug took effect. In the darkness surrounding me, I could hear Bill Bennett talking, 'This is my brother, Bob. He and I work as one unit. We are alien to this dimension, two beings from another plane.' The high-tech light display swirling around me convinced me I was transforming dimensions with them.*""

- Cathy O'Brien [1]

""*They dealt a lot with physics, not nuclear physics - where they really were trying to find ways to explore other dimensions. I don't know if they were using us to see if we could do it. I don't know what the deal was, but it seriously messed up my head. It was really nice to get verifications from other survivors that yes, they really did try to do this with some of them.*""

- Kathleen Sullivan [2]

Horrific genetic experiments, human cloning, and slave breeding programs are another part of NASA's hidden projects. This also ties into the 'aliens' that many victims have reported seeing while being programmed to think they were 'abducted'.

""*WM: 'Let's go to something you mentioned about the alien part in terms of mind control and the New World Order implementation plan. How do you think this is tied to the phenomenon of the growth of allegations of being abducted by aliens? Do you feel people are being experimented on by the government instead of aliens?*""

""*KS: 'Absolutely. I realize that there are some MK survivors who will strongly disagree with me, I am just going by what I have experienced and remembered. A lot of us were hypnotized and otherwise tricked into believing that we had been abducted by aliens, when actually it was government connected handlers who were using us for illegal activities. One thing the Nazis were working on very hard was genetic experimentation on some of their prisoners in the concentration camps, although our government has tried to suppress the documentation. And they were into breeding their own. My dad used to brag about how they were doing genetic experiments on embryos that were creating what they called 'children'. These children are, I personally believe, aliens...little ones that people have seen. I met several at a NASA facility. One was an older child, I guess I would call it. He was able to speak two languages. He was able to speak English and what they called a 'trilateral language'. He used a lot of buzzes and clicks and symbolic hand signals. He also had a lot of Theta abilities. He had been programmed — as I understand some of the others had that were genetically experimented on — to believe that they are aliens. It is one of the biggest crimes that an agency of our country has ever perpetrated against another human. What I understand is that with all the UFO movies lately, and so many TV shows about it in the last few years, it is preparing people's minds to believe that aliens are real, that they really do exist, that they really are trying to contact us. I can't help but wonder if some of these human 'aliens' will be used down the road as some kind of proof to people.'*""

""*WM: 'So these people, you believe, have been genetically altered through genetic engineering to look like aliens, or what the public has been conditioned to view as an alien?'*""

""*KS: 'I met several breeders of these people...One woman's husband worked for NASA...There was another woman I met back in 1988 in a reprogramming facility who also was a breeder...these seemed to be generational experiments, genetically, and specifically done for that purpose.'*""

- Kathleen Sullivan [2]

""*There were corporate rituals done while I was in Colorado, as well. They have many underground military ritual sites in the Colorado mountains. A billionaire, Illuminati leader that is in the news a lot recently and is an ANTIFA funder; funds testing on cloning and artificial intelligence in these areas. He is connected to many previous American presidents. The money of the elite goes to buying the presidency and their agenda in this country. This Illuminati leader has set up cloning research labs that are connected to NASA and the military.*""

NASA is also involved in advanced weapon research, 'New World Order' planning, and secret 'UFO' [technology development](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1cmf8f5/comment/l31qbxq/). See also: '[Mystery Space Machines](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KxzjayV00Iholm3lZs4hPbq_qZq-HXuU/view)'.

""*Wayne Morris (interviewing Kathleen Sullivan): 'Do you have any indication of U.S. government or German government use of UFO technology...that they have developed craft?'*""

""*KS: 'I was exposed to some of that. I saw at least one UFO for sure. It was in a garage, a large room where there was a door where the thing could go out into the open. It wasn't touching the ground. It was an amazing thing. It had a fantastic looking metal to it...I was absolutely fascinated by it. I have been told that they started out by using these craft, which they said were created by the some of the German scientists. They will talk about V2's on Discovery channel, but they will never ever bring up this end of it...what they had as far as technology and [brought it over with them](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1ctfy38/comment/l4dml87/). I think NASA is the biggest cover for this stuff. I understand that there is a base in the Himalayas as well, and that there are some facilities under oceans where some of the stuff is also stored, way, way out of detection areas. They do seem to be able to go down in deep, deep areas of water including one place near Hawaii. But they supposedly started out, or so I have been told by a number of people, using magnetic grids they called it, I don't understand that kind of technology...'*""

""*WM: 'The earth itself has a large electromagnetic grid field around it, and it is my understanding that they have used that kind of energy somehow in conjunction with creating these craft...'*""

""*KS: 'You say it better than I could, all I know is they talked about it and again, Dad bragged about that too. I have also heard that nowadays they don't use that particular kind of technology any more.'*""

- Kathleen Sullivan [2]

""*A fleet of UFOs with NASA stamped on their shell were stored on an underground conveyor belt system at Pine Gap.*""

- Fiona Barnett [9]

""*Lyle Curran, a NASA employee and Craig's uncle, often tapped into my NASA mind files when we went to their home in Los Alimitos or when we met up with them on our numerous trips to Mexico, mostly Mazatlan. From the information Uncle Lyle accessed from my mind files way back in the 60's, 70's, 80's, rockets and missiles were a thing of the past, and directed energy in the form of weaponry systems was what they were planning on using as the new weapons of the future. No one can see it coming, nor defend against it. They could take out the lights in entire cities and blame it on UFO's. The Department of Defense experimented for a long time, until they mastered this technology. It puts nuclear weapons right out of business.*""

- Brice Taylor [10]

""*...We kept them looking the other way as we were secretly using the copious profits from the sales to fund more mind control research, so the plan for the world takeover could be implemented. All this was done by very smart and manipulative people who used very strategic planning. Saudi Arabia and other foreign countries inadvertently funded a lot of NASA research.*""

- Brice Taylor [10]

""*...This does not mean that everyone in NASA, or anywhere is evil; it just states the truth that there are evil people in every area: government, entertainment, schools, and churches; and the list goes on.*""

Whenever you say why they do not go back to the Moon people claim NASA has no funding and therefore cannot do jackshit. Yeah right. Google it. **NASA has an annual budget of over $25 Billion dollars.** And with that large amount of money they do not know how to build a brand new 2024 futuristic space shuttle and moon lander to fly to the Moon? That is more than enough money, and if you **accumulate 2020 through 2024 that is over $100 Billion dollars** which is plenty of funding to fly back to the moon.

So explain to me why they do not build a new 2024 lunar lander? They have the money they need. If they flew to the Moon in the 1960s they should know how to build a brand new lunar lander with 2024 supercomputer technology. **They have the money. They have the know-how** since they flew 6 times to the Moon already. So tell me what are they waiting for? Seriously are they still trying to figure out how to fly through the Van Allen Radiation Belts all over again? Do they still not know how to shield their spacecraft from the intense radiation?"

2) There are far too many spies within lebanese territories to do so.

Watch that video and the rhetoric in the video from Gaza, it is almost word for word.

If any other country in the world was to commit the bomb attacks with the pagers and walkie talkies there would have been non stop coverage of the terrorist entities that did it, and about them needing to face justice.

A friend of the Harris family clarified in an interview that Kamala's grandmother Beryl was indeed NOT black.  They psychologically gaslighted millions of people into supporting her with this LIE. As some of you may have seen and even commented on, I made [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/s/MCnvYMWLZK) post regarding the recent string of episodes by Candace Owens that explore Kamala Harris' genealogy; in particular, the nagging suspicion that her Grandmother, Beryl, who is credited as pictured next to Kamala in a photo from the 90's where she's supposedly visiting Beryl, could actually NOT be Beryl because she supposedly died 4 years prior to Kamala being born.

Now, I naturally received a ton of comments ""debunking"" the post, vilifying Candace for being a ""grifter"" and accusing myself and Candace of racism. There were a few people, however, who had also seen the episode and/or were either interested in the subject or in debunking it. 

For example, there were many who claimed that Candace had the wrong birth certificate and that Beryl actually died in 1995. Well, I would say that *that* isn't the part that *really* matters, anyway. 

As since that time we've learned a *lot* more about her family & their connections to Freemasonry and people like Jamaican Communist Dictator Bustamante. There have also been other journalists and influencers who have started digging into her background. For those who say this is invasive and racist, please remember who started this race hustle in relation to Kamala and who made it a key part of why we ""need"" to vote for her in the first place. 

Anyway, of those who are doing research into this topic, there's one in particular who has uncovered some peculiar information. 

Scroll to [13:17](https://www.youtube.com/live/SI7YtjXlZc0?si=u3HOTG8OZKlapfhO) to listen to an interesting interview by a Jamaican woman called ""Lady C"", who has a background in genealogy and was asked about this situation by her viewers. She happened to track down a woman who knew the family *personally*, and doesn't seem to have a malicious bone in her body when it comes to them; meaning, she wouldn't have any reason to try to lie about or smear them. 

And she confirmed what we all thought (and what Judge Joe Brown said years ago) when we saw that woman posed next to Kamala in that photo: her Grandmother, Beryl, was a *fair-skinned Irish woman*, and the lady in that photo? Likely, ""The Help."" Sigh.

So for months we have heard that ""JD Vance is weird"" ""JD Vance wants to control women's rights"" ""JD Vance wants to track women's periods"" yall get it typical reddit propaganda preying on unintelligent and emotional voters.

Well I just got done watching the whole Rogan interview from beginning to end and I've basically come to the conclusion that you can inverse anything you find on the front page of reddit and the exact opposite will be true, kind of like WSB, just kidding you guys at least are based in some of evidence.

After watching the interview I have to say JD is a super likeable really well spoken dude , I even appreciate the fact that he doesn't try to play a politician but really comes off as a dude you'd be friends with.

So typically when I get home from work I like to see how insane the front page of reddit is and wanna see how they spin this shit and of course we have the usual suspect of subs taking things out of context or just straight up fabricating what was said on the podcast. JD literally said that he has no plans on banning abortions or controlling women's autonomy but somehow the propagandist on reddit fabricate what they say.

Now is more important than ever , all of us need to get out and vote, we need to put an end to this madness and get some sense of fairness back in our politics.

Also for those of you asking ""what's the conspiracy"" the conspiracy is that reddit is blatantly spreading misinformation and gaslighting people between the ages of 18-40 to sway elections and spread propaganda. Any fact checking or correcting these people leads to an instaban furthering actual misinformation and causing election interference."

If 5 years ago you could afford 100 things and have 500 Dollars left at the end of the month and now you can afford just 90 things and have nothing left - then you are objectively doing worse. But some people outside the 20% - actually believe that they are doing better despite not being able to afford food at the end of the month."

1712539044,peopl disabl kill want ill give face someth vaccin fact lie took kind could,"Most people who took the ""vaccine"" don't want to face the fact that they were lied to and took something that could kill them or give them all kinds of illnesses and disabilities. Whenever someone makes a post in this sub about the bad effects of the ""vaccine"", many people in the comments talk about how they took it and they're fine, as if that means other people can't react differently to the same thing. It's pretty mind blowing the lengths people are going to defend an experimental medication made by corrupt pharmaceutical companies that have been fined billions of dollars in the past. Not only that, but governments around the world literally coerced people into taking it, and yet 4 years later, people are still ignorant of all the data showing what the shots are doing to people. And most of them are so dumb that they think if the shot was meant to depopulate the planet then everyone would've died immediately after taking it or something. Which is silly.

One of the top funders of the shots was Bill Gates and he thinks there are too many people on the planet for fucks sake. Why would he want you take an injection that could prolong your life? Why would all these people in positions of power care about your health?

It's now becoming clear to me that the shots actually affect people's cognitive abilities (the contents go through the blood-brain barrier) and that's why most people who took the shot are now basically incapable of questioning it and thinking critically. No matter what evidence you show them, they literally can't see what's going on.

Even pfizer's own clinical trial documents that they didn't wanna release for 50 years (I wonder why...) show that more than 1200 people died during the trials. Unfortunately most people are so dumbed down (especially those who took the shot) that they don't even know where to find information about the jab. All they know about it is from mainstream media sources that are funded by big pharma. It's amazing how stupid humanity has become, so maybe we deserve to get depopulated at this point because what's going on couldn't be more obvious. The simple fact that Bill Gates (a eugenicist) said he wants every man, woman and child to take the shot should tell you all you need to know to [avoid the shots.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6etX7Acs7dI&ab_channel=Breaze)"

1733564254,wa war lie fuck terror,"The war on terror was a fucking lie. To understand this, look at Syria right now. It's being overwhelmed by a bunch of Islamic militants calling themselves HTS, who used to be former Al Nusrah, ISIS, Al Qaeda etc... They've been reformed under mostly one banner in the last 6 years or so with Turkish, Israeli, American, and ""Ukrainian"" intelligence. This was always the plan once the Russians got busy in Ukraine.

Basically what has happened over the last few years is that all the terrorist groups in Syria got reformed, retrained, and re-equipped in Turkey and were sent in at the designated time. 

The leader of HTS is former Al nusrah, ISIS in Iraq, and Al Qaeda in Iraq. He fought against American soldiers. 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Mohammad_al-Julani

He is a terrorist. Even the US designates him as such, and yet he is getting fucking interviews from CNN.

Remember those guys that attacked America on 9/11 supposedly? We totally support them now. They are our little terrorist army. Maybe they always were? We give them weapons, training, funding, and even fucking CNN interviews. 

The whole war on terror is a fucking lie.

1716205102,skin cancer say lie everyth,"Everything they say about skin cancer is a lie 
In the 80's private equity and big pharma teamed up to do the impossible: convince people the sun was bad for them. Once they did this, knowing it would deplete humans of their most vital nutrient, they had customers for life.

Nearly all skin ""cancers"" wouldn't kill you if you lived to 1000 years old. They are harmless.  The only skin cancer to be fearful of is melanoma.  What causes melanoma? A LACK of sunlight. Over 80% of Melanomas are on areas not in sunlight.

Hiding from the sunlight is especially sinister because it causes a laundry list of actual problems.  Depression and mental illness are the most prevalent. Risk of heart disease and other cancers more than double. Hiding from the sun is worse than smoking. A smoker with normal vit D levels can expect to live longer than a non-smoker who is deficient.

Sunblock has been around for decades. Despite this there has been no change at all in the mortality rate of skin cancer. When a sunblock user gets cancer what does a dermatologist tell them? They didn't use enough! Silly. There is more evidence sunblock is toxic and causes cancer than the opposite.

Get as much sunlight as you can. It is free which is why they hate it. Low vit D levels are an epidemic. Get your levels check and supplement."

1716767252,celebr initi swift kati part scar ritual lohan taylor dure satan press lie receiv lindsay leg perri,"Celebrities such as Taylor Swift, Katy Perry and Lindsay Lohan have scars on their legs received during Satanic rituals or initiations and lied to the press about it, as part of the ritual.  Lindsay Lohan claimed to have received a massive wound on her leg from a broken tea cup. 
The story is told very sketchy by her and her mother. 
Explaining the cut, Lindsay Lohan was having breakfast with friends “with eggs and everything,” and she was carrying a tea cup and dropped it, where it broke and cut and possibly burned her leg. 

Taylor Swift explains a scar on her leg from an accident with a hot glue gun, because she was making a popsicle stick doll house using a glue gun and got too zealous with the glue and it dropped on her leg and burned her. 

Katy Perry was wearing a flesh colored stocking on the Graham Norton show and was specifically asked about her leg. 
She told the chat show audience that she cut her leg on a glass coffee table. 

There may be more instances of celebrity women explaining cuts on their legs. 

My theory is that it’s part of a Satanic blood ritual, that probably involves demeaning sex and humiliation.

 Part of the activation of the magic is to publicly present the scar, and lie about it, as part of the deal. 
The vow of silence.

Option 1) All oil and fossil fuel literally comes from decayed liquified, carbon-based creatures and lifeforms, who died millions of years ago, OR Option 2) John Rockefeller lied about oil's scarcity, and it's actually very abundant and self-replenishing on Earth? The **abiotic oil theory** purports that oil is actually super abundant and reoccuring throughout the entirety of the Earth's surface and crust.  There are even ""oil springs"", much like a water spring, where oil replenishes quickly and frequently.  Essentially, we will never run out of oil here on Earth.

Do you really trust John D. Rockefeller, a businessman so shrewd that his legacy lives on in the American Empire to this very day?  After all, he was the one who called oil a ""fossil fuel"", claiming it was extremely scarce.  The benefit this would serve him is that it would make it seem as though oil is a scarce product and people would pay money for it.  In reality, it is more something like water or air.

1713129846,lie recycl,"All recycling is a lie 100% - all of them, all the campaigns and arguments for recycling is a lie.

What are they?  They're efforts to drive down the cost of materials....that's it.  Because when you drive down costs, you increase profits.

BUT in order to motivate people to take action, you have to give them a cause, a reason to think ""I'm better than you are because...."" OR ""I love my <name something> so I'm going to recycle""

Look at electronics - they tell you there are limited supplies, that harvesting is expensive and all that.  SO recycle your electronics because we don't want them filling up the landfills

What's the newest one?  Prescription medicines.  They're telling us ""Oh you can't flush your meds because city water treatment plants can't clean the chemicals out of the water so turn the unused meds into the pharmacy"" - what they don't tell you is that those pills are either resold immediately to the public OR they're sent to a ""recycling facility"" where they're combined with other drugs of the same kind and repackaged and sold as new to pharmacies.

They can clean poop, including all the chemicals we poop out.  Unused, unprocess, undigested chemicals like supplements are processed and so are the drugs you flush.

Don't believe the hype.  All they're trying to do is drive down costs which will drive up their profits."
